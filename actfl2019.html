            <p><strong><a href="#challenge">The Challenge: Translation software has become too good.</a></strong> New developments in artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and mobile computing have made possible language tools and apps that present new challenges to foreign language instruction. The convenience and enhanced accuracy of deep-learning online translators, automated proofreaders, and real-time electronic interpreters make their abuse more appealing to language learners and more difficult to detect for language instructors. Traditional plagiarism countermeasures that rely on forewarning and enforcing negative sanctions have difficulty in dissuading these practices.</p>
            <div><strong><a href="#solutions">Preventing dishonesty without banning technology.</a></strong> To combat the abuse of these technologies, we draw on nudge theory to suggest strategies that proactively nudge students away from bad practices without curtailing the availability of technology in the classroom or compromising known best practices. In fact, many of these "nudges" push students to adopt <i>better</i> academic and life skills.</div>

The author composed the original source text to deliberately fool the original translation as a demonstration (and deterrent) to students.
                </div>
                <p><strong>Existing translation tools are getting too good to detect (and will only get better).</strong> Tools like Google Translate have been significantly revamped to produce increasingly accurate results. Not long ago, such tools anecdotally produceed texts of problematic quality (see Tables 1 and 2), impressions that were studies more or less confirmed. In a medical settings, Frances Sheppard discouraged professional use of Google Translate for French-English translation (566), as did Patil and Davies for patient interactions, both studies noting accuracy concerns. As late as 2016 (but likely submitted <i>after</i> the major updates below, both Chen, et. al., and Lelte, et. al. (968), recommended against using Google Translate between English and Chinese and English and Ukrainian, respectively.</p>
                <p>However, advents in new deep-learning technologies will made our ridicule of these tools' accuracy obsolete. Behind the scenes, there has been a major shift from rule-based statistical modelling to artifical-intelligence-based adaptive methods. Introduced in 2016, Google's Neural Machine Translation offers the promise of more believable results now as well as increasingly accuracy over time. While previous methods relied on statistical analysis of real-world corpora, these new techniques can predictively produce language that they have never encountered before (<a href=-"https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/11/zero-shot-translation-with-googles.html">Schuster et. al. 2016</a>). As Ramati and Pinchevsik note: "The neural network improves translation not only of language pairs with abundant data (e.g. English-German) but also, remarkably, translation of language pairs with relatively little available data" since "the system is able to implement implicitly what it learns from one translation procedure to the other" (2561). Limited research seems to bear this out: while discouraging its use in medical situations with lesser-taught languages, Krieger, et al., observed high accuracy in Google-Translate-produced texts in Tagalog (95%), although this varied significantly between languages (Armenian had the lowest accuracy with 55%). While such results may prevent their effective use in medical situations where interlocutors encounter specialized vocabularies, such results would surely be "good enough" in the context of a classroom where students produce texts on relatively banal topics, especially when dealing with more commonly-taught languages that already have large corpora. Indeed, Google appears <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/translate/higher-quality-neural-translations-bunch-more-languages/">committed to expanding the number of languages</a> that use this new method (Turovsky 2017).</p>
                <p>We may have already passed the Turing test when it comes to translators: Machine-produced translations can believeably considered to be human-generated. How can we then easily <i>prove</i> when a student has used such a tool when confronted with a text that they clearly could not have done.</p>

            <p><strong>New tools are making translation easier to use and more portable.</strong> Not only machine translators more accurate, they are easier and more portable. Included in every one of its smartphone apps, Google Translate includes augmented reality functionality, which allows real-time translation of visible texts (see Image 1), as well as a real-time oral translator, which can produce adequate voice renditions in a second language from either textual or oral input in another (See Video 1).</p>
            <p>Putting aside more distant concerns that such technologies could be use to "fake" an oral exam, the ease of use, convenience, and ubiquity of such tools makes their <i>ab</i>use potentially more lucrative to students. The power to translate anything anywhere may also discourage students from engaging further in language learning beyond academic requirements.</p>

        <h3 id="solutions">Potentional Solutions</h3>
        <p>This presentation develops interventions inspired by <i>nudge theory</i> as outlined by Thaler and Sunstein
        and <a href="http://www.behaviouralinsights.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BIT-Publication-EAST_FA_WEB.pdf">the United Kingdom government's Behavioural Insights Team</a>. Rather than influencing behavior only through the prospect and  enforcement of negative consequences, nudge theory aims to a modify a
        person's or group's "choice architecture", or mental calculus of self interest, through subtle incentives and indirect suggestions, e.g. by putting fruit at eye level rather than banning junk food (Thaler
        and Sunstein 6).
        To implement such strategies, the Behavioural Insights Team suggests the following so-called "EAST" tactics (Behavioural Insights Team 4-6):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Make it <strong>E</strong>asy.</u> If possible, the desired choice should offer the path of least resistance, e.g. by making it the default option, by reducing hassles associated with 
                that option, or by simplifying the messaging pertaining to such a choice.</li>
            <li><u>Make it <strong>A</strong>ttractive.</u> The desired choice should be aesthetically pleasing. Reinforce behaviors by using materials that draw attention, or design rewards and sanctions 
                that make the desired option desireable beyond its immediate economic value (i.e. its grade value).</li>
            <li><u>Make it <strong>S</strong>ocial.</u> The desired choice should be viewed as the socially preferred option. Show that most students behave in the target manner, use existing social
                networks to normalize desired habits, and encourage accountability among a class.</li>
            <li><u>Make it <strong>T</strong>imely.</u> Target interventions for times when they will be most effective. Prompt students when they are most receptive, make desired choices appear more
                immediately appealing in the short term, and provide scaffolding that helps students make the desired choice later on.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Nudge theory works particularly well in this context of academic honesty in that they can work when the implementor (or "choice architect") has a limited ability to enforce prohibitions or mandates.
            Thaler and Sunstein note that "[n]udges are not mandates" insofar as they "alter people's behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives," (6). 
            Thus, these tactics allow instructors to avoid blanket bans on all technology, e.g. by making essays into closed-book in-class assignments, and allows technology that can be
            pedagogically useful. Moreover, many of the "nudges" detailed below also encourage best-practice study habits.</p>
        <h4 id="accountability">Foster classroom accountability and empathy</h4>
        <p>By building a sense of accountability and empathy in the classroom, teachers can dissuade dishonest behaviors. By letting oneself be seen as an "actual human being" and
            by encouraging communality among among students, the instructor can induce a sense of mutual obligation in students that adds emotional consequences to dishonesty.</p>
        <h5>Make yourself personable</h5>
        <p>Reduce the sense of stratification between teacher and student by developing a personal repore with students. Actively let your students know that
            you care about them, their best interests, and their personal development.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Have individual getting-to-know-you meetings.</strong> At the beginning of each term, have each student fill out a <a href="https://forms.gle/xcGZ9Fwh2i57jur2A">survey
                    about themselves</a> and then come to your office hours for a 5 minute meeting just to get to know each other (but plan on meetings lasting a little longer because you <i>will</i>
                    find your students interesting). Not only will it help your student find your office and become comfortable in such a one-on-one setting, but it will help them see you as 
                    approachable and a real person with feelings and sympathies. Don't underestimate the Walmart Greeter Effect, that is, how being acknowledged by another human being can make one
                    more conscientious of social obligations and aware that they are not anonymous and free of observation.</li>
                <li><strong>Show how your policies are a compact between you and your students' best interests.</strong> Position yourself as an advocate of your students' best interests as learners
                    and your policy on plagiarism not as an arbitrary rule, but as an expression of your concern for their learning, e.g. "I want to make sure that you understand what you are writing so that you'll be prepared
                    for the next topic in the course, course in the language series, capstone examination, future corporate meeting, etc." Students should come to understand education as a mutual agreement,
                    where the instructor's...</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h5>Glorify positive behaviors</h5>
        <p>Rather than only demonizing bad practices, make academically honest practices attractive to students by exhaulting their benefits beyond just getting a good grade.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Compare negative <i>and positive</i> examples.</strong> Alongside your plagiarism statement include a
                    <a href="https://jakevanderkolk.xyz/ger_101-fs_2019-syllabus.html#policies">list of desirable practices juxtaposed to bad practices</a>, which not only helps students understand
                    the distinctions between these practices, but also provides alternatives that they can use instead. Then have students take an <a href="https://forms.gle/6nH2GGAjZnH8p67N9">open-book
                    quiz</a> that tests knowledge of these distinctions (along with other basics of the course) which they can retake an infinite number of times. Not only are students forced to learn
                    what counts as academic dishonesty, instructors also gain documentation that students (should) know appropriate behavior.</li>
                <li><strong>Model successful study habits.</strong> Provide a list of effective study practices, i.e. 
                    <a href="https://jakevanderkolk.xyz/ger_101-fs_2019-syllabus.html#succeeding">"Tips for Success"</a>, and emphasize how most past successful students used these tactics. Not only
                    does this simply how students can engage with the coursework, it applies a bit of "peer pressure" and a sense of obligation in the same way as the Behavioural Insights Team <a
                    href="https://www.bi.team/blogs/behavioural-insights-tax-trials-win-civil-service-award/">increased tax payment rates by advertising that most citizens paid their taxes</a>. Likewise
                    note the utility of these habits beyond this particular course, e.g. how a particular memorization technique can be used in other classes.</li>
                <li><strong>Give acclaim and other small rewards for honest performances.</strong> Providing a small but meaningful acknowledgement (e.g. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1otLmR0g3cEfnp6CzcUA8yycFM6WtFRQuQYm647suGDk/edit?usp=sharing">with
                    a "collectible" tchotchke</a>) for honestly-earned (but not necessarily perfect) writing reinforces those positive efforts. Exhibiting and praising a particular honest work (without 
                   reference to its originator if needed) can incentivize other students to act accordingly.</li>
                <li><strong>Group students strategically.</strong> Group individual students with higher chances of academically dishonest behavior away from similar students and with
                    students who exhibit positive academic and study habits. The at-risk student will not only witness that academically honest study habits are common among classmates, but this
                    student may "apprentice" such skills from classmates.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4 id="preemption">Preempt Risky Attitudes</h4>
        <p>Instructors can mitigate feelings of frustration and desperation before they lead to plagiarism by cultivating support structures, such as study groups, accessible feedback, and supplementary materials, and by proactively intervening with at-risk students.</p>
        <h5>Make your own support structures the best default</h5>
        <p>If students can see your own support structures as a default, i.e. the most readily available immediate choice (and not just the <i>best</i> choice, they will be less likely to turn to dishonest
            substitutes.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Make feedback plentiful, useful, and easy.</strong> Allow students to use social media to contact you for guidance, and try to give quick turnaround on that feedback. Use utilities like <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Docs</a>
                    for written assignments so that you can return feedback before the next class session. Provide an online forum in your course management system where students can ask mundane questions
                    from their peers or you.</li>
                <li><strong>Provide an abundance of course materials.</strong> Providing alternative explanations or even better different types of media explaining a concept will assist learners who
                    may be less amenable to your given lecture style. Of particular use are video lectures like those of <a href="https://resources.german.lsa.umich.edu/ger101/vorlesungen/">Hartmut Rastalsky at the University of Michigan</a>,
                    which can provide perhaps even remedial help for higher-level students who may be too shy to ask for help.</li>
                <li><strong>Facilitate study groups and co-hort participation.</strong> Remind students of the wealth of resources available to them including peer tutoring. Introduce students to one another
                    in class based on their living situations, e.g. group together students who live in the same parts of campus or who have a common course of study (and thus will be more inclined to work
                    together already). Prevent individual students from feeling isolated and anonymous, so that they develop support networks as well as a sense of mutual accountability with their classmates.</li>
                <li><strong>Allow flexibility to foster ownership.</strong> Have students gain a sense of ownership over their learning by building in flexibility to your courses. Give students multiple alternatives to assignments
                    or extra-curricular activities that appeal to them.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h5>Intervene Preemptively</h5>
        <p>Don't wait for plagiarism to occur, stop it before it happens by identifying and regularly intervening with at-risk students. By doing so, you can make their learning experience not only easier and better,
            but also demonstrably remind them that you are both concerned for them and that you hold them accountable.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Have sit-down sessions with struggling students.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Track and inform students of missing assignments, absences, and low performance.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Have confidence-building assignments.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Have a mid-semester "check in" for each individual student.</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4 id="perceptions">Change Perceptions</h4>
        <p>Through careful instructional design, instructors can have students implicitly change their mental calculus toward plagiarism by making honest methods easier, more advantageous to the student's short and long-term goals, and more enjoyable than dishonest methods.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Depict honest practices as easy.</strong> Don't just make your academically honest practices look like the <i>best</i> and <i>most advantageous</i> for students, show how they can also be the <i>easiest</i>.
                    Provide a set of "lazy" tips that reinforce good habits that make plagiarism less lucractive, e.g. suggest that students use otherwise "wasted" time (standing in lines, waiting for class to start) on vocabulary learning, so that they have
                    enough active vocabulary to not need an online translator. Emphasize how such habits are not only easier (e.g. than sitting for hours memorizing vocabulary), but also more effective.</li>
                <li><strong>Punish the apparent outcomes of dishonesty.</strong> Write your assignments narrowly to make certain structures less likely to appear, and overtly prohibit grammatical features that students have not learned yet. In German, for instance, apply a significant penalty to unattested grammatical features such as passive voice expressions, and make students rewrite those structures "in language that we have learned in this class". Point out to students that you want them to specifically show you that they can successfully use what they learned <i>in this class</i>.</li>
                <li><strong>Design assignments in ways that make dishonesty less practical.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Use technology that tracks student writing.</strong> Tools like <a href="https://drive.google.com">Google Docs</a> can track what and when students write. Remind students of this capability, and your ability to "catch" them doing suspicious things, and tell them to write directly in this program instead of copying-and-pasting from another word processor.</li>
                <li><strong>Make assignments multi-staged.</strong> Instead turning in one massive assignment (which many if not most students will do the night before its due date), students should have assignments that break out into distinct steps due progressively over the span of days or weeks. Translator use becomes less appealing when assignments appear managable in since. Moreover, this encourages students to practice better study habits.</li>
                <li><strong>Require Revisions.</strong> In the same vein, have students turn in multiple revisions instead of one final, high-stakes version. Allow students to make mistakes and make correction part of the process of learning.</li>
            </ul>
