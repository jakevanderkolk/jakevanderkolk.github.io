            <h3 id="solutions">Potentional Solutions</h3>
            <p>This presentation develops interventions inspired by <i>nudge theory</i> as <a href="http://www.behaviouralinsights.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BIT-Publication-EAST_FA_WEB.pdf">outlined by
            the United Kingdom goverment's Behavioural Insights Team</a>. Rather than influencing behavior only through the prospect and  enforcement of negative consequences, nudge theory aims to a modify a
            person's or group's "choice architecture", or mental calculus of self interest, through subtle incentives and indirect suggestions, e.g. by putting fruit at eye level rather than banning junk food.
            To implement such strategies, the Behaviorial Insights Team suggests the following so-called "EAST" tactics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><u>Make it <strong>E</strong>asy.</u> If possible, the desired choice should offer the path of least resistance, e.g. by making it the default option, by reducing hassles associated with 
                    that option, or by simplifying the messaging pertaining to such a choice. (Behavioural Insights Team 4)</li>
                <li><u>Make it <strong>A</strong>ttractive.</u> The desired choice should be aesthetically pleasing. Reinforce behaviors by using materials that draw attention, or design rewards and sanctions 
                    that make the desired option desireable beyond its immediate economic value (i.e. its grade value). (Behavioural Insights Team 5)</li>
                <li><u>Make it <strong>S</strong>ocial.</u> The desired choice should be viewed as the socially preferred option. Show that most students behave in the target manner, use existing social
                    networks to normalize desired habits, and encourage accountability among a class. (Behavioural Insights Team 4)</li>
                <li><u>Make it <strong>T</strong>imely.</u> Target interventions for times when they will be most effective. Prompt students when they are most receptive, make desired choices appear more
                    immediately appealing in the short, and provide scaffolding that helps students make the desired choice later on. (Behavioural Insights Team 6)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Not only do these tactics allow instructors to avoid blanket bans on all technology, e.g. by making essays into closed-book in-class assignments, including applications that can be
                pedagogically useful, such tactics also align with existing best practices EXTEND THIS HERE.</p>
            <h4 id="accountability">Foster classroom accountability and empathy</h4>
            <p>By building a sense of accountability and empathy in the classroom, teachers can dissuade dishonest behaviors. By letting oneself be seen as an "actual human being" and
                by encouraging communality among among students, the instructor can induce a sense of mutual obligation in students that adds emotional consequences to dishonesty.</p>
            <h5>Make yourself personable.</h5>
            <p>Reduce the sense of stratification between teacher and student by developing a personal repore with students. Actively let your students know that
                you care about them, their best interests, and their personal development.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Have individual getting-to-know-you meetings.</strong> At the beginning of each term, have each student fill out a <a href="https://forms.gle/xcGZ9Fwh2i57jur2A">survey
                        about themselves</a> and then come to your office hours for a 5 minute meeting just to get to know each other (but plan on meetings lasting a little longer because you <i>will</i>
                        find your students interesting). Not only will it help your student find your office and become comfortable in such a one-on-one setting, but it will help them see you as 
                        approachable and a real person with feelings and sympathies. Don't underestimate the Walmart Greeter Effect, that is, how being acknowledged by another human being can make one
                        more conscientious of social obligations and aware that they are not anonymous and free of observation.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h5>Glorify positive behaviors.</h5>
            <p>Rather than only demonizing bad practices, make academically honest practices attractive to students by exhaulting their benefits beyond just getting a good grade.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Compare negative <i>and positive</i> examples.</strong> Alongside your plagiarism statement include a
                        <a href="https://jakevanderkolk.xyz/ger_101-fs_2019-syllabus.html#policies">list of desirable practices juxtaposed to bad practices</a>, which not only helps students understand
                        the distinctions between these practices, but also provides alternatives that they can use instead. Then have students take an <a href="https://forms.gle/6nH2GGAjZnH8p67N9">open-book
                        quiz</a> that tests knowledge of these distinctions (along with other basics of the course) which they can retake an infinite number of times. Not only are students forced to learn
                        what counts as academic dishonesty, instructors also gain documentation that students (should) know appropriate behavior.</li>
                    <li><strong>Model successful study habits.</strong> Provide a list of effective study practices, i.e. 
                        <a href="https://jakevanderkolk.xyz/ger_101-fs_2019-syllabus.html#succeeding">"Tips for Success"</a>, and emphasize how most past successful students used these tactics. Not only
                        does this simply how students can engage with the coursework, it applies a bit of "peer pressure" and a sense of obligation in the same way as the Behavioural Insights Team <a
                        href="https://www.bi.team/blogs/behavioural-insights-tax-trials-win-civil-service-award/">increased tax payment rates by advertising that most citizens paid their taxes</a>. Likewise
                        note the utility of these habits beyond this particular course, e.g. how a particular memorization technique can be used in other classes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Give acclaim and other small rewards for honest performances.</strong> Providing a small but meaningful acknowledgement (e.g. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1otLmR0g3cEfnp6CzcUA8yycFM6WtFRQuQYm647suGDk/edit?usp=sharing">with
                        a "collectible" tchotchke</a>) for honestly-earned (but not necessarily perfect) writing reinforces those positive efforts. By exhibiting and praising a particular honest work (without 
                       reference to its originator if needed) can incentivize other students to act accordingly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Group students strategically.</strong> Isolate individual students with higher chances of academically dishonest behavior from similar students and place or team them
                        with students who exhibit positive academic and study habits. The at-risk student will not only witness that academically honest study habits are common among classmates, but this
                        student may "apprentice" such skills from classmates.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
                <h5>
            <h4 id="preemption">Preempt Risky Attitudes</h4>
            <p>Instructors can mitigate feelings of frustration and desperation before they lead to plagiarism by cultivating support structures, such as study groups, accessible feedback, and supplementary materials, and by proactively intervening with at-risk students.</p>
            <h4 id="perceptions">Change Perceptions</h4>
            <p>Through careful instructional design, instructors can have students implicitly change their mental calculus toward plagiarism by making honest methods easier, more advantageous to the student's short and long-term goals, and more enjoyable than dishonest methods.</p>
