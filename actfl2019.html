            <h4 id="intro">How do we deal with new technology that makes academic dishonesty <i>easier</i>, <i>more accurate</i>, and <i>harder to detect</i>?</h4>
            <p><strong><a href="#challenge">The Challenge: Translation software has become too good.</a></strong> New developments in artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and mobile computing have made possible language tools and apps that present new challenges to foreign language instruction. The convenience and enhanced accuracy of deep-learning online translators, automated proofreaders, and real-time electronic interpreters make their abuse more appealing to language learners and more difficult to detect for language instructors. Traditional plagiarism countermeasures that rely on forewarning and enforcing negative sanctions have difficulty in dissuading these practices.</p>
            <div><strong><a href="#solutions">Preventing dishonesty without banning technology.</a></strong> To combat the abuse of these technologies, this presentation draws on nudge theory to suggest strategies that proactively, yet tacitly, entice students away from bad practices without curtailing the availability of technology in the classroom or compromising known best practices. In fact, many of these "nudges" push students to adopt <i>better</i> academic and life skills, improve rapport among students and their instructors, and make the foreign language classroom a more enjoyable setting. Suggested methods include:</div>

                languages, a popular notion may emerge that foreign language education will become superfluous. As educators it becomes incumbent on us to promote how our discipline is broader than merely
                teaching <i>linguistic</i> competency, i.e. that language learning is about the other four "C"s of the <a href="https://www.actfl.org/sites/default/files/publications/standards/World-ReadinessStandardsforLearningLanguages.pdf">ACTFL

The author composed the original source text to deliberately fool the original translation as a demonstration (and deterrent) to students.</div>
                </div>
                <h5>Existing translation tools are getting too good to detect (and will only get better).</h5>
                <p><strong>Once ridiculed.</strong> Not long ago, tools like Google Translate anecdotally produced texts of problematic quality (see Tables 1 and 2), impressions that limited studies more or
                    less confirmed. In medical settings, Sheppard discouraged Google Translate for French-English translation (566), as did Patil and Davies for patient interactions,
                    both studies noting accuracy concerns. As late as 2016 (but likely submitted <i>after</i> the major updates below, both Chen, et. al., and Lelte, et. al. (968), recommended against using
                    Google Translate between English and Chinese and English and Ukrainian, respectively.</p>
                <p><strong>No one's laughing now.</strong> However, advents in new deep-learning technologies <i>will</i> render ridicule obsolete. Behind the scenes,
                there has been a major shift from rule-based statistical modeling to artificial-intelligence-based adaptive methods. Introduced in 2016, <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/11/zero-shot-translation-with-googles.html">Google's Neural Machine Translation</a> offers
                    the promise of more believable results now as well as increasingly accuracy over time. While previous methods relied on statistical analysis of real-world corpora, these new techniques
                    can predicatively produce language that they have never encountered in corpora before (<a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/11/zero-shot-translation-with-googles.html">Schuster et.
                    al. 2016</a>). As Ramati and Pinchevsik note: "The neural network improves translation not only of language pairs with abundant data (e.g. English-German) but also, remarkably,
                    translation of language pairs with relatively little available data" since "the system is able to implement implicitly what it learns from one translation procedure to the other" (2561).
                    Limited research hints at this future: while discouraging its use in medical situations with lesser-taught languages, Krieger, et al., observed high accuracy in
                    Google-Translate-produced texts in Tagalog (95%), although this varied significantly between languages (Armenian had the lowest accuracy with 55%). <i>While such results may prevent their
                    effective use in medical situations (where interlocutors encounter specialized vocabularies) such results would surely be "good enough" in the context of the classroom</i> where students
                produce relatively banal language that is well attested in the existing corpora. Not even lesser-taught languages are immune as <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/translate/higher-quality-neural-translations-bunch-more-languages/">Google implements this new backend to more and more languages (Turovsky 2017)</a>.</p>
                <p>In sum, <strong>we may have already passed the Turing test</strong> when it comes to translators: Machine-produced translations can believably considered to be human-generated. How can we
                    then easily <i>prove</i> when a student has used such a tool when confronted with a text that they clearly could not have done.</p>

            <h5>New tools are making translation easier to use and more portable.</h5>
            <p><strong>Strong machine translation is trivially available.</strong> Not only are machine translators more accurate, they are easier and more portable. Included in every one of its smartphone
                apps, Google Translate includes augmented reality functionality, which allows real-time translation of visible texts (see Image 1), as well as a real-time oral translator, which can produce
                adequate voice renditions in a second language from either textual or oral input in another (See Video 1).</p>
            <p>Putting aside more distant concerns that such technologies could be use to "fake" an oral exam, <strong>the ease of use, convenience, and ubiquity of such tools makes their <i>ab</i>use potentially more lucrative</strong> to students. The power to translate anything anywhere may also discourage students from engaging further in language learning beyond academic requirements.</p>

        <p>This presentation develops interventions inspired by <strong>nudge theory</strong> as outlined by Thaler and Sunstein (2008)
        and <a href="http://www.behaviouralinsights.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BIT-Publication-EAST_FA_WEB.pdf">the United Kingdom government's Behavioural Insights Team (2015)</a>. Rather than influencing behavior only through the prospect and  enforcement of negative consequences, nudge theory aims to a modify a
        person's or group's "choice architecture", or mental calculus of self interest, through subtle incentives and indirect suggestions, e.g. by putting fruit at eye level rather than banning junk food (Thaler
        and Sunstein 6).
        To implement such strategies, the Behavioural Insights Team suggests the following so-called "EAST" tactics (Behavioural Insights Team, 2015, 4-6):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Make it <strong>E</strong>asy.</u> If possible, the desired choice should offer the path of least resistance, e.g. by making it the default option, by reducing hassles associated with 
                that option, or by simplifying the messaging pertaining to such a choice.</li>
            <li><u>Make it <strong>A</strong>ttractive.</u> The desired choice should be aesthetically pleasing. Reinforce behaviors by using materials that draw attention, or design rewards and sanctions 
                that make the desired option desireable beyond its immediate economic value (i.e. its grade value).</li>
            <li><u>Make it <strong>S</strong>ocial.</u> The desired choice should be viewed as the socially preferred option. Show that most students behave in the target manner, use existing social
                networks to normalize desired habits, and encourage accountability among a class.</li>
            <li><u>Make it <strong>T</strong>imely.</u> Target interventions for times when they will be most effective. Prompt students when they are most receptive, make desired choices appear more
                immediately appealing in the short term, and provide scaffolding that helps students make the desired choice later on.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Nudge theory is ideal for academic honesty</strong> in that it can work when the implementor (or "choice architect") has a limited ability to enforce prohibitions or mandates.
            Thaler and Sunstein note that "[n]udges are not mandates" insofar as they "alter people's behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic
            incentives," (6). Thus, these tactics allow instructors to
            <ul>
                <li><u>Avoid blanket bans on all technology</u>, e.g. by making essays into closed-book in-class assignments and allow technology that can be pedagogically useful, and</li>
                <li><u>Provide a better classroom experience</u>, since many of these "nudges" coincidentally encourage best-practice study habits.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Nudge theory can work alongside your existing academic honesty policies.</strong> By not overtly prohibiting or allowing practices, nudge theory approaches need not conflict with departmental
        or institutional plagiarism policies. <i>Many of these nudges occur seek to <u>avoid</u> these policies from ever having to be enforced</i>, and as such can save the instructor (and the instition) much
            of the headaches associated with formal dishonesty proceedings.</p>
        <h4 id="accountability">Foster Classroom Accountability and Empathy</h4>
        <p>By building a sense of accountability and empathy in the classroom, teachers can dissuade dishonest behaviors. By letting oneself be seen as an "actual human being" and
            by encouraging communality among among students, the instructor can induce a sense of mutual obligation in students that adds emotional consequences to dishonesty.</p>
        <h5>Make yourself personable</h5>
        <p>Reduce the sense of stratification between teacher and student by developing a personal rapport with students. Actively let your students know that
            you care about them, their best interests, and their personal development.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Have individual getting-to-know-you meetings.</strong> At the beginning of each term, have each student fill out a <a href="https://forms.gle/xcGZ9Fwh2i57jur2A">survey
                    about themselves</a> and then come to your office hours for a 5 minute meeting just to get to know each other (but plan on meetings lasting a little longer because you <i>will</i>
                    find your students interesting). Not only will it help your student know how to find your office and become comfortable in such a one-on-one setting, but it will help them see you as 
                    approachable and a real person with feelings and sympathies. Don't underestimate the "Walmart Greeter Effect," that is, how being acknowledged by another human being can make one
                    more conscientious of social obligations and aware that they are not anonymous and free of observation.</li>

                    and your policy on plagiarism not as an arbitrary rule, but an expression of your concern for their learning, e.g. "I want to make sure that you understand what you are writing so that you'll be prepared
                    for the next topic in the course, course in the language series, capstone examination, future corporate meeting, etc." Alter the narrative around education from transactional to one of

        <h5>Glorify positive behaviors</h5>
        <p>Rather than only demonizing bad practices, make academically honest practices attractive to students by exhaulting their benefits beyond just getting a good grade.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Compare negative <i>and positive</i> examples.</strong> Alongside your plagiarism statement include a
                    <a href="https://jakevanderkolk.xyz/ger_101-fs_2019-syllabus.html#policies">list of desirable practices juxtaposed to bad practices</a>, which not only helps students understand
                    the distinctions between these practices, but also shows good-practice alternatives that they can follow. Then have students take an <a href="https://forms.gle/6nH2GGAjZnH8p67N9">open-book
                    quiz</a> that tests knowledge of these distinctions (along with other basics of the course). Allow them to retake this quiz an infinite number of times until they get it completely correct. Not only are students forced to learn
                    what counts as academic dishonesty, instructors also gain documentation that students (should) know appropriate behavior.</li>
                <li><strong>Model successful study habits.</strong> Provide a list of effective study practices, e.g.
                    <a href="https://jakevanderkolk.xyz/ger_101-fs_2019-syllabus.html#succeeding">"Tips for Success"</a>, and emphasize how <i>most the <u>most successful</u> students used these tactics</i>. Not only
                    does this simplify how students can engage with the coursework, it applies a bit of "peer pressure" and a sense of obligation in the same way as the Behavioural Insights Team <a
                    href="https://www.bi.team/blogs/behavioural-insights-tax-trials-win-civil-service-award/">increased tax payment rates by advertising that most citizens paid their taxes (Behavioural Insights Team 2013)</a>. Likewise
                    note the utility of these habits beyond this particular course, e.g. how a particular memorization technique can be used in other classes.</li>
                <li><strong>Give acclaim and other small rewards for honest performances.</strong> Providing a small but meaningful acknowledgement (e.g. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1otLmR0g3cEfnp6CzcUA8yycFM6WtFRQuQYm647suGDk/edit?usp=sharing">with
                    a "collectible," tongue-in-cheek tchotchke</a>, Image 2) for honestly-earned (but not necessarily perfect) linguistic production reinforces those positive efforts. Exhibiting and praising a particular honest work (without 
                reference to its originator if needed) can incentivize other students to act accordingly.</li>
                <li><strong>Group students strategically.</strong> Split up students at risk of academically dishonest behavior (those with lower grades or bad study habits) and group them with
                    students who exhibit positive academic and study habits (but not necessarily the <i>highest grades</i>). The at-risk student will not only witness that academically honest study 
                    habits are common among classmates, but this student may "apprentice" such skills from classmates.</li>
            </ul>

        <div style="font-size: 0.8em;"><strong>Image 3.</strong> A sample comment from an instructor's revision of a Google Docs document. The instructor used a set of pre-made snippets that included
            a detailed explanation of the issue, where the student could find additional information, and an example correction of the error. Snippets could then be copy-and-pasted into comments, providing
            fast and detailed help on their written work.</div>
        </div>
        <p>Instructors can mitigate feelings of frustration and desperation before they lead to plagiarism by cultivating support structures, such as study groups, accessible feedback, and supplementary materials, and by proactively intervening with at-risk students.</p>
        <h5>Make your own support structures the default</h5>
        <p>If students can see your own support structures as a default, i.e. the most readily available immediate choice (and not just the <i>best</i> choice, they will be less likely to turn to dishonest
            substitutes.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Make feedback plentiful, useful, and easy.</strong> Allow students to use social media to contact you for guidance, and try to give quick turnaround on that feedback. Use utilities like <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Docs</a>
                    for written assignments so that you can return detailed feedback before the next class session (Image 3). Provide an online forum in your course management system where students can ask mundane questions
                    from their peers or you.</li>
                <li><strong>Provide an abundance of course materials.</strong> Providing alternative explanations or even better different types of media explaining a concept will assist learners who
                    may be less amenable to your given lecture style. Of particular use are video lectures like those of <a href="https://resources.german.lsa.umich.edu/ger101/vorlesungen/">Hartmut Rastalsky at the University of Michigan</a>,
                    which can provide perhaps even remedial help for higher-level students who may be too shy to ask for help. For those with limited time, keep a document with links to outside resources which you can copy-and-paste into
                    each of your course's course management pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Facilitate study groups and co-hort participation.</strong> <i>Remind</i> students of the wealth of resources available to them including peer tutoring. Introduce students to one another
                    in class based on their living situations, e.g. group together students who live in the same parts of campus or who have a common course of study (and thus will be more inclined to work
                    together already). Prevent individual students from feeling isolated and anonymous, so that they develop support networks as well as a sense of mutual accountability with their classmates.</li>
                <li><strong>Allow flexibility to foster ownership.</strong> Have students gain a sense of ownership over their learning by building in flexibility to your courses. Give students multiple alternatives to assignments
                    or extra-curricular activities that appeal to them.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h5>Intervene Preemptively</h5>
        <p>Don't wait for plagiarism to occur, stop it before it happens by identifying and regularly intervening with at-risk students. By doing so, you can make their learning experience not only easier and better,
            but also demonstrably remind them that you are both concerned for them and that you hold them accountable.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Have sit-down sessions with struggling students.</strong> Invite (or mandate) that students who perform under a certain level on tests come in to discuss their difficulties, not only with course content, but also study and work habits. Provide simple tips to help make their experience easier and more successful, and use this opportunity to be personable with them.</li>
                <li><strong>Track and inform students of missing assignments, absences, and low performance.</strong> Send a quick E-Mail whenever a student does surprisingly poorly, is unexpectantly absence, or shows drastic changes in classroom performance. Let them know they have a support network, and that they are not just anonymous faces to you. <i>Don't (just) remind them of negative consequences of their actions.</i> Show how you want to be a resource to them, not a disciplinarian.</li>
                <li><strong>Have confidence-building assignments.</strong> Students find certain assignments, expecially oral exams or presentations, especially nerve-wracking. Earlier in the semester, assign essentially "trial run" versions of these exercises. Make them worth real points, and take them extremely seriously, but grade lightly and give effusive praise. Remember that language learning is both amazing and terrifying: Amazing in how quickly students go from knowing nothing to being capable of <i>surviving</i> in a foreign land, and terrifying in that this task requires profound changes in how one thinks and identifies.</li>
                <li><strong>Have a mid-semester "check in" for each individual student.</strong> If a significant number of students are struggling or many are afraid to come to see you on their own, consider having all of your students come visit you during office hours just to have an individual check up, have a little small talk, and to get a feel class sentiments. By making this mandatory for a whole class, students can avoid feeling the stigma of "being called into my office," and will often be more open in a one-on-one setting rather than among peers.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4 id="perceptions">Change Perceptions</h4>
        <div style="float: right; margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em; max-width: 30%; font-size: 0.8em;">
            <img src="google-docs-version-history.png" style="max-width: 100%; margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; border: 1px solid black;" />
            <div style="font-size: 0.8em;"><strong>Image 4.</strong> An example version history in a Google Docs document, showing expected (honest) behavior. Notice how individual small edits take place over a longer span of time (in total, 28 edits of typically less than a sentence over roughly an hour cumulatively), which would be laborious to falsify. Checking this log in suspicious cases can provide more evidence of potential dishonesty, since students who use something like Google Translate would just copy-and-paste entire paragraphs. Requiring students to write entirely in Google Docs, and then requiring complete rewrites when content is clearly copied-and-pasted, can make translator use extremely impractical. (Used with permission with identifying information redacted)</div>
        </div>
        <p>Through careful instructional design, instructors can have students implicitly change their mental calculus toward plagiarism by making honest methods easier, more advantageous to the student's short and long-term goals, and more enjoyable than dishonest methods.</p>
        <h5>Emphasize "lazy" honest practices</h5>
        <p>Don't just make your academically honest practices look like the <i>best</i> and <i>most advantageous</i> for students, show how they can also be the <i>easiest</i>. Emphasize those practices that are simple or easy, but also make dishonesty less lucrative.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Activities for "wasted" time.</strong> Note small activities that students can do during otherwise "wasted" time (standing in lines, waiting for class to start, riding the bus, looking at cat pictures). Suggest students install a flash card app like <a href="https://www.memrise.com/">Memrise</a> on their phone that they can pull out at odd moments. Point out that students are not only doing something easy, they are learning vocabulary in a more efficient, effective way (in short bursts). By having more active vocabulary, students will have less need for other crutches, like online translators.</li>
                <li><strong>Short bursts!</strong> Encourage students to do small amounts of foreign language learning every day instead of in large chunks.</li>
                <li><strong>Emphasize <i>efficiency</i> over <i>duration</i>.</strong> Students often assume that <i>longer is better</i>. Point out study techniques that are more efficient, and can save students time (but also maintain that students must still put in adequate time.)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h5>Design assignments less amenable to dishonesty</h5>
        <p>Consider how your assignments and assessments can contribute or dissuade certain habits, and design them to encourage responsible behaviors. In so doing, you can make academic dishonesty less practical.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spread out higher stakes assignments.</strong> Instead turning in one massive assignment (which many if not most students will do the night before its due date), students should have assignments that break out into distinct steps due progressively over the span of days or weeks. By making assignments appear more managable, one can make translators less appealing..</li>
                <li><strong>Require Revisions.</strong> In the same vein, have students turn in multiple revisions instead of one final, high-stakes version. Allow students to make mistakes and make correction part of the process of learning.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h5>Challenge symptoms of dishonesty</h5>
        <p>While we cannot necessarily know for sure if a student is a savant or a ringer who independently has learned otherwise unattested (suspicious) forms, we can disincentivize work that <i>looks</i> dishonest, and in so doing also encourage students to focus more narrowly on course lessons
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grade narrowly to course content.</strong> Have grading criteria that reward competency in cultural topics, grammar, and vocabulary introduced in your course. Conversely, penalize grammar and vocabulary unattested in your class and previous classes, and have students re-write offending passages in language appropriate for their level. Emphasize that such assignments should be representations of what they have learned <i>in this specific class</i> and as such, you expect them to make as much use of grammar and vocabulary from the course and course materials as possible, and not find outside crutches that they might not understand how to use properly.</li>
                <li><strong>Use technology that tracks student writing.</strong> Mandate that students use tools like <a href="https://drive.google.com">Google Docs</a>, which can track what and when students write, for out-of-class written assignments (Image 4). Require that students do <i>not</i> just copy-and paste from another word processor. If a student submits a suspicious assignment through this, and the revision history shows that they entered entire sentences, paragraphs, or a whole assignment at once (i.e. copying-and-pasting), have them redo the assgniment. Remind students of this capability, and your ability to "catch" them doing suspicious things.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>New possibilities for academic dishonesty provide <strong>an important testing ground for new strategies to shape, but not mandate, student behaviors</strong> for the better. Nudge theory frovides a framework not only for subtly directing students <i>away</i> from bad behaviors, but also <i>toward</i> advantageous habits that can improve their experience as students and prepare them for further success.</p>
        <p><strong>Moving beyond the Communicative Approach?</strong> Moreover, these new technologies and our countermeasures against them should cause us to reflect on our profession. Under the primacy of the Communicative Approach, we have over-emphasized the first "C" (<i>Communication</i>) of the ACTFL World-Readiness Standards. In the long term, we need to bring more emphasis to the other four "C"s of Readiness Standards (Image 5). As means of electronic augmentation make linguistic competency seem less and less pertinent to administrators, alumni, donors, and most importantly students, we need to bring to the fore more encompassing forms of competency, such as (inter)<i>cultural competency</i>.</p>
