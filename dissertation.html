            <h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>
            <p>My dissertation, which I defend in May 2017, dealt with early 20th Century stream-of-consciousness literature and narratology. It argued that such texts tried to intervene in the reader's everyday life by engaging the reader more interactively in the construction of narrative meaning. Nevertheless, my primary text, <i><a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Tod_des_Vergil">Der Tod des Vergil</a></i> (1945) (<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Virgil">The Death of Virgil</a></i>, 1945) by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Broch">Hermann Broch</a>, self-effacingly demonstrates the fraught contradictions and limitations of this mission.</p>
            <h4 id="overview">Chapter Overview</h4>
            <h5 id="1">1. Toward a Reader Response Theory of the Avant Garde Inner Monologue</h5>
            <p>My first chapter discusses my methodological approach and how it departs from traditional narratological approaches. First of all, it shows how the self-awareness of the avant-garde exposes and rectifies narratology's narrow scope. By examining treatments of avant-gardiste texts, it uncovers how existing narratology entangles itself in the Aestheticist tradition, which reaches its limit when encountering the avant-garde's unique historical self-consciousness. This requires us to revise those static, ahistorical hermeneutic and formalist methods into more pragmatically and historically minded methodologies. Secondly, this "pragmatic historicization" of narratology remaps narrative conventions regarding genre, form, technique, and style onto their historical functions. In particular, this chapter reappropriates the Avant Garde inner monologue as no longer a set of formalist properties but rather as a technique that involves the reader interactively in the process of meaning construction. Finally, this chapter rectifies Broch's own efforts to shape his reception within the wider context of this provisional theory. The contradiction between the author's idealized self-fashioning and his resignation toward aesthetic reception reveals an underlying "negative reception" at the heart of <i>Vergil</i>, a self-effacing criticality to its own avant-gardiste project.</p>
            <h5 id="2">2. The Existential Monologue: Innovations on Stream-of-Consciousness</h5>
            <p>Beginning with my second chapter, I examine how <i>Der Tod des Vergil</i> builds upon the Avant Garde inner monologue technique. It specifically demonstrates how Broch extends the technique by turning death itself into the driving force of the narrative. The primacy of death in Vergil expands the microcosmic scope of the narrative instance beyond cognition into cosmological speculation. In so doing, the text reframes the inner monologue's focus on detailing the psyche into an  interrogation of a prior sense of the existentialist subject. Unlike the quasi-psychologist role imagine for the reader in other avant-gardiste inner monologues, Broch's "existential monologue" pushes its reader to become introspective to her own Being.</p> 
            <h5 id="3">3. Now and Not-Now: A Liminal Setting</h5>
            <p>Chapter Three discusses the consequences that this narrative instance has on the setting of Broch's text. By focusing on the pre-individual sense of Being, <i>Vergil</i> instantiates a narrative instance that not merely recites the protagonist's inner life, but rather exceeds him and "universalizes" him beyond his immediate here-and-now. Death, and not the direct thoughts of Virgil, narrates this text. This alters the temporal relationship between text and reader. Like other inner monologues, Broch's work unfolds in a putative "real time" setting, whereby the time of reading corresponds roughly to the time of the plot, but also deepens this temporal relationship by introducing a tacitly co-existent network of signification. <i>Vergil</i> thus simultaneously unfolds in a liminal setting, or <i>Zwischenreich</i>, pregnantly suspended between the "now" of its protagonist and an immanent "not-now" introduced by Death. In distinction to the linear unfolding of the protagonist's present, this second temporality develops in a circular, recurrent fashion.</p>
            <h5 id="4">4. Traversing the Labyrinth: Plot and Counterplot</h5>
            <p>The fourth chapter argues that, in line with the dual temporalities at play, the text has a second "counterplot" that unfolds in a radically different fashion than its apparent plot. In contrast to the apparent linear plot that opens up diachronically through the present, the events that transpire in the hyperpresent unfold according to semiotic connections that non-sequentially conjoin past, present, and future. The form of the text presents three particular structural types which establish these connections. At the first level, paragraphs form the elementary framing of the dialectical moment, "architectonic" enclosures that interface the present and the hyperpresent. At the second level, characters and motifs comprise a heterogeneous web of references that conflate elements both within and outside of the text, creating a series of figural repetitions. At the final macrostructural level, <i>Vergil</i> itself appears as a repetition of previous "labyrinthine" texts, replicating a general downward spiral structure toward an (unreachable) center.</p>
            <h5 id="5">5. Pulverising Contrition: Virgil's Existential Ordeal</h5>
            <p>The last full chapter of this dissertation discusses how the counterplot serves as a model of existential and thereby narratological self-inquiry for the reader. The counterplot traces out a process of existential deconstruction and reconstruction through <i>Zerknirschung</i>, or rather "contrition," a pulverization of false consciousness back into its pre-human essence. In so doing, the text challenges the reader's desire for a sense of fullfilment as a sort of false beauty. Mating the depiction of self-destruction with the vicarious position afforded the reader in the inner monologue, <i>Vergil</i> itself takes the role of a psychopomp, leading the reader down the path toward his own existential self-interrogation. By pushing the reader into this position, the text does not provide the reader with the satisfaction of narrative desire, of an ending or final resolution. Despite Broch’s own claim to have presented a Platonic "total knowledge" in <i>Vergil</i>, the text instead engages the reader in a sort of Socratic inquiry that leaves it up to the reader to discover the truth at the center of the labyrinth.</p>
            <h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion. A Failed <i>Volksbuch</i></h5>
            <p>Finally, the conclusion of this dissertation briefly compares the text’s intended affect upon the reader with its actual reception . It discusses how <i>Vergil</i>'s aspiration to be a <i>Volksbuch</i> failed in Europe due to the text’s deliberate aesthetics of incompleteness, but oddly gained a small but positive following in North America. I suggest that this positive reception shows a correspondence between the text’s decentralization and the democratic sentiments of Broch’s adopted homeland.</p>
