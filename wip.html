                <strong>The Diversity of Queerness, 1918-1939</strong><br />
                Expanding on recent discussions on conservative expressions of homosexuality (e.g. Max Kramer, "From Georg Simmel to Stefan George: Sexology, Male Bonding, and Homosexuality," <i>German Studies Review</i> 41, no. 2 (2018): 275-296), this project will discuss other forms of Queerness and LGBTQ during the interbellum period, particularly conservative, misogynistic, and homophobic forms. As a beginning point, this project will begin with a reading of <i>Trommlerbub' unterm Hakenkreuz</i>, a National Socialist propaganda novel aimed at young adults and which strongly interrelates male-bonding, chauvinism, and homoeroticism in its appeal to young males.<br />

                <strong>Academic Honesty After Artificial Intelligence</strong><br />
                This presentation aims to inform teachers of nascent forms of academic dishonesty and suggest proactive strategies for preventing them. New developments in artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and mobile computing have made possible language tools and apps that present new challenges to foreign language instruction. The convenience and enhanced accuracy of deep-learning online translators, automated proofreaders, and real-time electronic interpreters make their abuse more appealing to language learners and more difficult to detect for language instructors. Traditional plagiarism countermeasures that rely on forewarning and enforcing negative sanctions have difficulty in dissuading these practices.<br />
                <br />
                To combat the abuse of these technologies, this presentation lays out strategies that aim to proactively prevent bad practices without significantly constraining the availability of technology in the classroom or compromising known best practices. In particular, this presentation presents three main avenues of action: Firstly, it encourages instructors to create a classroom culture of accountability. By using various “soft power” methods, teachers can facilitate a sense of mutual obligation from students to their peers as well as the instructor themselves, adding a “human face” and emotional consequences to the vice. Secondly, it promotes tactics that preempt student attitudes and habits that can lead to dishonesty. Instructors can mitigate feelings of frustration and desperation before they lead to plagiarism by cultivating support structures, such as study groups, accessible feedback, and supplementary materials, and by proactively intervening with at-risk students. Finally, this article proposes methods that adjust student perceptions in favor of honest practices. Through careful instructional design, instructors can have students implicitly change their mental calculus toward plagiarism by making honest methods easier, more advantageous to the student’s short and long-term goals, and more enjoyable than dishonest methods.<br />
