            <h3 id="teaching_philosophy">Statement of Teaching Philosophy</h3>
            <h5 id="beliefs">My Beliefs</h5>
            <p>I believe that all aspects of language learning, including speaking, writing, reading, listening, and cultural knowledge, should be stressed at every level of instruction. I also prioritize growth in grammatical, lexical, pronunciation, and pragmatic competency.</p>
            <p>Language instruction not only teaches a specific language, it develops interpretive and problem-solving skills. In the foreign language classroom, students must re-learn techniques and strategies unconscious in their first language, such as parsing meaning from context or circumlocuting complex thoughts in simple terms. At the same time, the foreign language presents many unfamiliar situations for which students must adapt new skills, like navigating formality conventions. Alongside the basic mechanics of the language, these less-tangible skills must be taught and practiced both in and outside of class. Moreover, such skills are useful beyond the classroom, teaching students how to process novel expression and adjust to unfamiliar contexts.</p>
            <p>Finally, my teaching strives to develop critical cross-cultural agency. Language should be taught by engaging students with the foreign culture and challenging their preconceived notions. Accordingly, the content of all my courses focuses on spurring critical thought, and incorporates assignments that challenge students to creatively reinterpret familiar topics or reassess their own culture in comparison with the foreign culture. Language learning can uniquely enrich those critical skills and creative talents that comprise essential parts of a well-rounded education.</p>
            <h5 id="class_management">Classroom Management and Interaction</h5>
            <p>As a teacher I strive first and foremost to create a collegial and comfortable environment in which students freely participate and take ownership of their learning. I attempt to fashion myself as a collaborator in students’ learning and advocate of their best interests. Starting with my syllabi, I proactively model positive learning habits, and preemptively intervene with individual at-risk students over the span of the term. I aim to make feedback quick, easy, and plentiful, making extensive use of cloud-based collaborative tools that allow my students to see my commentary in real time. Assessment in my courses serves first and foremost as a scaffolding for self-reflection and growth, providing students with the means to take charge of their own learning.</p>
            <p>Moreover, student feedback and contributions should significantly shape instruction. In my courses, students collectively produce discussion prompts, vocabulary lists, and test questions, and even help set the agenda of individual lessons. Such participation fosters students’ active investment in their own learning, making them more open to asking questions, more empathetic with peers, and more likely to complete homework assignments. Likewise, to help foster mutual responsibility and mitigate student differences, I extensively use peer activities that groups students of differing or complementary aptitudes and motivations. Students should feel that they have a stake in learning, and that instruction is responsive to their needs and interests.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I make strides to make language learning enjoyable and broadly appealing. As a tall white father in his thirties, I find students already much too deferential to me as an authority figure, so I attempt to maintain an empathetic and gregarious persona. My courses incorporate light-hearted accouterments when appropriate, e.g. references to current trends and popular culture and activities designed to illicit creatively humorous responses. Likewise, I like to present lessons and topics in a variety of ways, and to supply additional materials like online videos and excerpts from other textbooks in order to accommodate different learning styles.</p>
            <h5 id="organization">Session and Term Organization</h5>
            <p>Class sessions should be fast-paced and incorporate numerous exercises targeting various objectives and skills. Aside from the many speaking activities, sessions should also include writing, reading, and listening exercises. Class time should focus on practicing rather than learning about the language, with overt grammar instruction kept to a minimum. Instead, students should learn grammar predominately outside of class through the textbook and homework assignments.
My typical class session comprises four to five activities. I always begin with a warm-up activity that revisits a previous well-understood lesson and readies students for active participation. Such activities include short games, partner discussions, or simple whole-class question-and-answer exercises. Subsequent activities gradually reintroduce and build upon topics, structures, and vocabulary from the homework and previous sessions, and progress from heavily receptive and structured to increasingly productive and open-ended. In the last few minutes of a class, I briefly preview new concepts that students will encounter in the homework.</p>
<p>My courses structure learning as a compounding process over the span of the term. I persistently revisit and reuse topics and lessons across sessions, and students have numerous opportunities for practice and revision. I use low-stakes formative assignments to encourage experimentation and exploration. In advanced courses, my students maintain online reading journals, where they test out new ideas and language, discover useful vocabulary, and ease themselves into higher-stakes assignments. Similarly, I break summative assignments into multiple steps that revisit and improve on previous work. Students submit multiple preliminary versions of their projects and are required to make numerous revisions based on extensive feedback.</p>
