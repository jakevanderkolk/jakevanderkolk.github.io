            <h5 id="beliefs">My Beliefs</h5>
			<p>I believe that all aspects of language learning, including speaking, writing, reading, listening, and cultural knowledge, should be stressed at every level of instruction. I also prioritize growth in grammatical, lexical, pronunciation, and pragmatic competency.</p>
            <p>Through linguistic competency and cultural awareness, my instruction develops students’ abilities to negotiate meaning and act responsively in novel situations. At the same time, foreign studies cultivate how to negotiate unfamiliar situations, like navigating formality intricacies or conventions on public spaces. These less-tangible skills are useful beyond beyond the classroom, showing students how to flourish in novel social milieus (a Viennese opera house, a corporate board room) and idiolects (Goethe’s poetry, English medical jargon) both outside and within their own culture.</p>
			<p>My teaching thus facilitates student growth in cross-cultural agency. Students should become not only fluid, proficient speakers of German and resplendent authorities on Germanophone culture, but also highly adaptable actors who responsibly engage and empathize with the unknown and uncomfortable.</p>
            <h5 id="class_management">Classroom Management and Interaction</h5>
			<p>I strive to create a collegial and comfortable environment where students act responsibly, take ownership of their own learning, and gain confidence and curiosity. Alongside the established best practices of my discipline, Nudge Theory strongly informs my implementation of these goals.</p>
			<p>By becoming empathetic with their instructor and their peers, students should feel that they have a personal stake in their own and their classmates’ learning. I hold casual one-on-one meetings with all  students at least once a semester to build rapport and offer guidance. I facilitate a sense of solidarity among classmates through frequent group work, projects, and games.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, I proactively structure my courses to nudge students toward sustainable, successful habits. For example, regular, low-stakes formative work induces disciplined routines, lessens anxiety, and scaffolds less-prepared learners. Summative assessment serves first and foremost as a medium for self-reflection and growth, providing students with the means to take charge of their own learning. Students are afforded replete opportunities for revision. I am also experimenting with Specifications Grading and Ungrading practices.</p>
			<p>My courses foster confidence and self-exploration. Over the semester, I proactively model best practice study habits through the design of my assignments, e.g. by breaking summative assignments into more manageable chunks. To combat fears of inadequacy, my courses include  confidence-building exercises, like an oral “test” where students tangibly experience their own progress. In my courses, students explore on their own through self-directed cultural enrichment work. Here, they integrate course content into their everyday life through small, everyday activities, such as switching their phone’s language to German, or teaming up with German speakers in online video games.</p>           <h3 id="student_comments">Student Comments</h3>
            <h5 id="c_beliefs">Beliefs</h5>
            <p class="cv4"><i>Appreciated the different style of course (compared to other German courses I’ve taken here). [...] Helped my speaking & writing in German considerably.</i> (German Composition, Kalamazoo College, Winter 2018)<p>
			<p class="cv4"><i>The readings were quite good, though they were difficult to read due to my limited German vocabulary. For that, however, the reinforcement of our contextual skills was very helpful for learning how to get a general understanding of a passage.</i> (German Composition, Wabash College, Fall 2020)</p>
			<p class="cv4"><i>I currently feel comfortable enough to express certain thoughts in German. But especially something like getting food or perhaps now, asking for directions. And we often examined the cultures of German-speaking nations by showing regional differences in the language or comparing things like restaurant culture</i>. (Elementary German 1, Wabash College, Fall 2021)</p>
            <h5 id="c_class_management">Classroom Management and Interaction</h5>
			<h6>Empathy and Accountability</h6>

            <p class="cv4">Student evaluation question: <i>Students’ ideas and contributions were encouraged.</i> Average of responses:
