            <p>Your computer has a variety of powerful tools that you likely have never known about. Especially if you use a macOS or other UNIX-like (e.g. Linux) machine, your computer contains a huge number of free utilities that you can chain together to perform sophisticated quantitative textual analysis. You only have to learn a little bit about the command line.</p>
            <p><strong>Keine Panik!</strong> You may feel at first intimidated by the command line, but with a little practice, you will quickly figure out how to do rudimentary activities fairly easily.</p>
            <h3>The Basics</h3>
            <h4>Open A Terminal</h4>
            <h3>Using Git in the Humanities</h3>
            <h5>What is <em>Git</em> and why should I use it?</h5>
            <p><strong><em><a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a></em></strong> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">Version Control System</a> that can help you keep track of and coordinate your personal or collaborative projects. Originally designed for software development, <em>Git</em> is extremely flexible and very capable of dealing with humanities-related content. In particular, it can act as the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A Changes Tracker.</strong> Think of it as an "Undo" button that allows you to restore any previous version of a file or group of files.</li>
                <li><strong>A Synchronization Tool.</strong> <em>Git</em> allows you to download or upload a file or group files among multiple locations, e.g. your own personal desktop computer, a repository on GitHub, your laptop, a smartphone, or your office computer.</li>
                <li><strong>A Collaboration Coordinator.</strong> When working on a project with other people (or from different locations), <em>Git</em> tracks who does what and when, and tries to help resolve when contributions overlap.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are just a few of the possible uses of <em>Git</em>. With a little experience, you can conceivably do even more with this tool, as many have already done.</p>
