            <h3>Using Git in the Humanities</h3>
            <h5>What is <em>Git</em> and why should I use it?</h5>
            <p><strong><em><a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a></em></strong> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">Version Control System</a> that can help you keep track of and coordinate your personal or collaborative projects. Originally designed for software development, <em>Git</em> is extremely flexible and very capable of dealing with humanities-related content. In particular, it can act as the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A Changes Tracker.</strong> Think of it as an "Undo" button that allows you to restore any previous version of a file or group of files.</li>
                <li><strong>A Synchronization Tool.</strong> <em>Git</em> allows you to download or upload a file or group files among multiple locations, e.g. your own personal desktop computer, a repository on GitHub, your laptop, a smartphone, or your office computer.</li>
                <li><strong>A Collaboration Coordinator.</strong> When working on a project with other people (or from different locations), <em>Git</em> tracks who does what and when, and tries to help resolve when contributions overlap.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are just a few of the possible uses of <em>Git</em>. With a little experience, you can conceivably do even more with this tool, as many have already done.</p>
