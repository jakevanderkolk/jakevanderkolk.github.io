    <h3 id="description" style="clear:both;">Course Description and Objectives</h3>
    <div class="body">
      <p>In German 101, you will start learning to communicate in German through speaking, writing, listening, reading, and cultural knowledge. Over the course of the semester, you will learn vocabulary (as well as grammatical and cultural knowledge) in order to interpret oral and written language, to interact with other speakers, and to express yourself. Students who diligently complete the tasks of this course will meet or exceed the <a href="https://www.actfl.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/public/ACTFLProficiencyGuidelines2012_FINAL.pdf">ACTFL "Novice" levels (see page 9)</a> for speaking, reading, listening, and writing.</p>
      <p>Our course will include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>in-class activities, including pair and group work focusing on using the new structures and vocabulary in a variety of contexts. <i>Active participation is essential!</i></li>
        <li>daily homework, including grammar readings, vocabulary memorization, and extra practice. <i>You will learn the grammar and vocabulary just as much on your own as in class!</i></li>
        <li>cultural readings including short texts, films, TV episodes, short videos, and music</li>
        <li>a lab session once a week with a Foreign Language Teaching Assistant (FLTA) for extra German practice</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>Elementary German I complies with the <a href="http://bulletin.wabash.edu/academic-policies/course-information/">Wabash College Academic Credit Policy</a> stated in the Academic Bulletin. In addition to regular class meetings, direct instruction in this course takes place through lab sessions, office hours, cultural enrichment activities outside of class, face-to-face oral examinations, and feedback on written and performative work.</p>
    </div>
    <h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
    <div class="body">
      By the end of this course, students
      <ul>
        <li>will begin to develop an active vocabulary in German, focusing on those elements that are most frequently used in classroom and interpersonal communication.</li>
        <li>will acquire basic grammatical structures (e.g., verb conjugations, past-tense forms, subordinate clause constructions, etc.)</li>
        <li>will be able to read and derive meaning from short, straightforward texts.</li>
        <li>will become able to express personal meaning both orally and in writing at a novice level.</li>
        <li>explore an array of cultural topics that will deepen their understanding of German, Swiss, and Austrian culture.</li>
      </ul>For a complete description, see this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzXviPTztgqlWVp1VGM5T01RME5QV0ZZdXQxQjZPS3BhQjNZ/view?usp=sharing">course's unabridged Student Learning Outcomes document</a>.

      <p><strong>No "Textbook" Required!</strong> We are using a new online-only curriculum developed at Princeton University and adapted for Wabash students: <i><a href="https://dddgerman.org/">der|die|das</a></i>. This curriculum innovates by focusing on the 1,200 most frequently used words in German. Each chapter presents (on average) 80 words from this list, which subsequent chapters review in varying formats, allowing you to develop a solid grasp of the most frequently used words in the language. By the end of the 100-level sequence, we will have learned about 800 of the 1,200 core vocabulary words!</p>

      <p class="body1">For each class and lab session, you will receive 1, 0, or -1 points for your participation grade, depending on the following criteria.</p>
      <ul class="body1">
        <li>
          <strong>Presence.</strong> If you miss a class or lab session, you will receive -1 point for that session. <i>However,</i> you can still get 1 point by submitting an "asynchronous" attendance assignment within <u>48 hours</u> of your missed session. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScryMCj4WoF-BvsAFlc6edu81izc5Eqj2EXq2opiKO4cZe8LQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">Follow the directions in this form to do so</a>. For college-sanctioned excused absences, you may submit the assignment within 48 hours of the end of the event.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="body1">For each class and lab session, you must do <i>all</i> of the following to get 1 point (no partial credit):</p>
      <ul class="body1">
        <li><strong>On Time.</strong> You are no more than 5 minutes late.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Engagement.</strong> You involve yourself in all class meetings, including group and whole-class activities, and make a <u>good faith</u> effort to express yourself <u>in German</u>. If you are in a distant session, you must have your video on if you are on-campus (but stay muted unless you are speaking). However:
          <ul>
            <li><strong><s>Linguistic Correctness.</s></strong> <strong>You are <u>not</u> expected to speak perfectly,</strong> just to try your best as often as you can with the language you have learned!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Preparation.</strong> You come to class ready and willing to practice the vocabulary, grammar, and topics touched on in your homework and previous class sessions. You have all necessary materials (books, worksheets, notes, etc.) at hand.</li>
        <li><strong>Cooperation.</strong> You support and encourage your fellow students. Be an asset to others' learning, and they will be an asset to you.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="body1">Your final grade in this criterion will be the percentage of aggregate points divided by maximum possible points.</p>
      <h4>Homework (15%)</h4>
      <p class="body1">Each day you should check the homework plan posted on <a href="https://wabash.instructure.com/courses">Canvas</a>. It is your responsibility to complete homework as assigned on a daily basis.</p>
      <p class="body1"><strong>Expect to spend 1-2 hours on homework and preparation for each class session.</strong> Please see me if you feel you are working more than this amount.</p>
      <div class="body1">
        There is no partial credit for individual assignments. To get full credit, you must do all of the following:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>On Time.</strong> You submit the set of assignments on time, <strong>even if you will be absent that day.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Completion.</strong> You submit all parts of all assignments due that day. Every single blank of every single assignment must be filled in.</li>
          <li>Present a <strong>good faith effort</strong>, that is, you try to genuinely engage with the material. It is <u>not</u> good faith to just copy-and-paste answers from the answer sheet or give a one word answer for a question asking for a complete sentence.</li>
          <li><strong>Correction.</strong> You check your submission against the provided answer key and resubmit it at least once if you find significant problems.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p class="body1">Your overall grade in these criteria will be the percentage share of assignments fully completed. There are two different types of homework assignments:</p>
      <ul class="body1">
        <li><strong><i>Der|Die|Das</i> Homework.</strong> Online exercises out of our "textbook".</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Quizlet Vocabulary.</strong> Each day you should study an assigned section of the chapter vocabulary. Every two class periods, you will have to show that you've learned the Thema's vocabulary by completing <a href="https://quizlet.com/join/cKguXS2Yn">Quizlet</a> a "Learn" or "Spell" activity.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="body1"></p>
      <h4>Chapter Tests (50%, 10% each)</h4>
      <p class="body1">Each chapter will have a test, which will include cultural content from our course. While focusing on new material, each test assumes continued mastery of the previous chapters. You will take tests outside of class through Canvas.</p>
      <ul class="body1">
        <li>
          <strong>Academic Honesty.</strong> You will be expected to complete these tests without external aids, even though you will be distant. See our <a href="#integrity">our course policy and the college policy on academic integrity below</a>. Vocabulary and grammar that we haven't learned yet will be considered academic dishonesty.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Missing a Test.</strong> Each test must be taken by posted deadline. Exceptions to this rule will be rare, and will require written notification from an appropriate administrative official. Otherwise, the test will not be rescheduled and will receive a score of "0".</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Final Oral Exam (10%)</h4>
      <p class="body1">There will be a final oral exam that you do with a partner.</p>
      <h4>Cultural Enrichment (5%)</h4>
      <p class="body1">Over the semester, you will participate in a certain number of cultural enrichment activities outside of class related to German-speaking culture, like watching a movie or attending a German Club meeting. <a href="./enrichment.html">See this list for possible activities</a>.</p>
      <p class="body1">You will submit a short report on the activity (in English) or provide some other evidence of completion. The number of necessary activities will depend on the amount of effort required, as well as when you submit your report (submissions in November count less than those in August).</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="succeeding">How to Succeed</h3>

      <iframe style="margin-left: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;border-width:1px;border-color:white;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yQq1-_ujXrM" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen width="280" height="158" frameborder="0" align="right"></iframe>
      <p>The most successful students typically do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Get your money's worth:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Use office hours.</strong> Email me to make an appointment, or feel free to "stop by" with questions! <strong>Don't suffer from FMOOWMP! →</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Speak lots! Make <u>lots</u> of mistakes!</strong> We use our precious class time for lots of speaking practice. I expect (and want!) you to make mistakes as you try out new vocabulary and grammar. This shows me how you've been learning.</li>
            <li><strong>Ask questions!</strong> When you’re lost or confused, or have a question in class, someone else probably has the same one (and they’ll be glad you asked).</li>
            <li><strong>Get help when you need it.</strong> If you feel overwhelmed or just don't understand something, get help <strong>NOW</strong>. This will save you aggravation and extra work further down the line. Take advantage of the extra videos I post, e-mail me, or come to my office hours.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Keep up.</strong> College language courses move fast, and everything we learn in this course assumes you know what we previously have learned. Students most often fail language courses because they fall behind. Make sure to:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Show up.</strong> Missing one or (even worse) multiple sessions will make each following session that much harder. While you can do a make-up after the fact, this assignment requires much more work than attending the session in the first place. Make things easier on yourself!</li>
            <li><strong>Complete all assignments <u>on time.</u></strong> Missing a day's worth of homework won't just cost you points, it will leave you unprepared for the next day's lesson and the next assignment.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Learn smarter, not longer.</strong> Expect to put in up to (but not more than) 2 hours of work outside of class for each hour of class and lab. However, studies show that people retain knowledge better when they learn small amounts at a time and review repeatedly. With a little foresight and planning, you can save time and frustration if you:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Build a routine.</strong> Set aside a few times every day to get <u>one</u> assignment done.</li>
            <li><strong>Study opportunistically.</strong> Use time that you might waste (e.g. standing in a long line, eating by yourself, waiting for class to start) practicing vocabulary instead of viewing cat photos on your phone.</li>
            <li><strong>Study moderate amounts every day.</strong> <u>You can’t learn a language by cramming.</u> You need to build your long-term memory. Instead of doing all your homework right before it is due or memorizing the vocabulary the night before a test, do a moderate amount every day and give yourself time to review your work.</li>
            <li><strong>Take breaks.</strong> If you do all your coursework in one big sitting, you may not be giving yourself time to let things sink in. Schedule in a break so that you don't work for more than an hour without taking some sort of a break.</li>
            <li><strong>If you get stuck, revisit later.</strong> If a particular lesson or exercise frustrates you, put it aside for a while, work on something else for a while, and let your brain reset. It may make sense later.</li>
            <li><strong>If you need more than 6 hours/week to keep up, or just feel overwhelmed, get help!</strong> Come and see me in my office hours, so that we can hash out methods that will work specifically for you.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><img src="https://jakevanderkolk.xyz/krampus.png" alt="Krampus liebt den Wortschatz" style="float:right; margin-left: 0.5em; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;" width="258" height="200"><strong>Find study partners.</strong> Get to know your classmates and form groups in which you can collaborate on day-to-day assignments, and study for tests. But make sure you still do your own work!</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Master the basics.</strong> Focus on learning the fundamentals. It took you decades to become a sophisticated speaker in your first language(s). <u>Rather than attempting to directly replicate this sophistication, aim instead at expressing ideas by creatively using the basics we learn here.</u>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Vocabulary, vocabulary, vocabulary!</strong> Having a strong working vocabulary makes everything easier and faster. Learn a few words every day. Use our Quizlet utilities or (even better) old-fashioned paper flash cards – find what works for you!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Make learning fun!</strong> Language learning need not be serious or dull! Make class fun and welcoming for yourself and your classmates by participating in lighthearted yet <u>respectful</u> ways.</li>
        <li><strong>Celebrate your progress!</strong> When you get frustrated, remember that you are doing something amazing: Over the next 15 weeks you will learn what took you <u>years</u> in your first language. Every once in a while, celebrate that accomplisment!</li>

        *Online translators haven't been the best at translating. A student, who was going to be absent in a course, once sent this email to a colleague named Rob:
        <div class="subnote">
          <i>Lieber Fruchtsirup: Ich verpasse heute die Kategorie</i>.<br>
          <br>
          English: <i>Dear Fruit Syrup: I'm passing by the category today.</i>†
          <div style="text-align: right;font-size:0.8em;">
            †She had entered "Dear Rob: I'm missing class today." in an online translator.
          </div>
        </div>Instead, rely first on the vocabulary you have learned and thus know well!

      <h4>The Gentleman's Rule</h4>
      <p class="body1">As with all other facets of Wabash life, the Gentleman's Rule applies to your interactions with me and your colleagues inside and outside the classroom, as well as to the completion of all academic requirements of the course. Except for leading an article discussion and data collection for the minilabs, all assignments and exams are to be completed independently, with no assistance from other people or other students’ work. Remember the Wabash mission statement: “Wabash College educates men to think critically, act responsibly, lead effectively, and live humanely.” Acting responsibly includes not cheating. <u>If there are any questions about how the standards of academic integrity apply to a specific assignment or test, please do not hesitate to talk with me for clarification <strong>before</strong> handing in the assignment.</u> Uncertainty about the application of these principles will not excuse a violation. Remember that you can be expelled for academic
      dishonesty!</p>
      <p class="body1">The general principle is that you should <strong>always submit work that is entirely your own.</strong> Here are some specific examples of academic dishonesty:</p>
      <ul class="body1">
        <li>Copying another student's exam or assignment – either a current or past student.</li>
        <li>Collaborating with another student on your term paper, article discussion summary, or minilab writeup.</li>
        <li>Using another student's notes for your article discussion summary.</li>
        <li>Copying any text from the internet (or other resource) on an assignment.</li>
        <li>Paraphrasing any text from any resource without providing a reference.</li>
        <li>Extensive paraphrasing of text from any resource even when providing a reference.</li>
        <li>Turning in the same assignment to multiple courses, in the same or different semesters, without prior consent from both professors.</li>
        <li>Taking another student’s graded assignment without his permission.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="body1">This is not an exhaustive list of violations. If you have a question, ask before you turn in the assignment.</p>
      <p class="body1">If I find out that you have cheated on an assignment, you will receive ZERO points for that assignment, and I will turn you into the Dean for an academic dishonesty strike.</p>
      <h4>Accommodations</h4>
      <p class="body1">Students who need accommodations (e.g. extra time for exams, separate testing room) are asked to arrange a meeting during office hours or by appointment the <u>first week of class</u>, or as soon as possible if accommodations are needed immediately. Accommodations will not be granted unless appropriate documentation is on file with Heather Thrush, Associate Dean for Student Engagement and Success.</p>
      <p class="body1">Students with disabilities (apparent or invisible) are invited to confidentially discuss their situation with the disability coordinator, Heather Thrush, Associate Dean for Student Engagement and Success. If a student wishes to receive an academic accommodation, it is required that his documentation of the disability be on file with Dean Thrush, who can, in confidence, provide information and guidance. Early notification helps us all work together in the most effective ways. To make an appointment with Dean Thrush call (x6347), or <a href="mailto:thrushh@wabash.edu">email</a>. Appointments will be available via Zoom or outside with masks and social distancing.</p>
      <h4>The Office of Student Enrichment</h4>
      <p class="body1">Succeeding at Wabash College takes a great deal of effort and planning. Life is complex, assignments are time consuming, and staying involved keeps you running. When you have questions about how to make everything fit into your schedule, how to study more efficiently, how to take better notes, or any other question about developing your college skills, visit the Office of Student Enrichment (OSE).</p>
      <p class="body1">Go <a href="https://www.wabash.edu/ace/office">here</a> and follow the "Make an Appointment" link to arrange a one-on-one, personalized meeting with Dr. Koppelmann. No matter your questions, Dr. Koppelmann will work with you to find a solution that helps you achieve your goals.</p>
      <p class="body1">All appointments will be online, and you will need to download Microsoft Teams.</p>

        <li>Counseling is available at <u>no additional charge</u> to students, their dependents, if any, and the college TAs. There are no session limits.</li>
		<li>The purpose of the Wabash College Counseling Center is to promote mental wellness by providing brief, therapeutic interventions and support as well as continued care for more chronic mental health conditions.</li>
		<li>When a student makes an appointment with the counseling center, we will assess, triage, and work with the student to develop a treatment plan and brief therapy to address the presenting issue and improve functioning.</li>
		<li>Counseling sessions are by appointment and can be made by sending an email to <a href="mailto:counseling@wabash.edu">counseling@wabash.edu</a>. We encourage students to be proactive regarding their mental health by reaching out to the counseling center when experiencing symptoms that do not appear to be resolving within a week or so of their onset or are worsening.</li>
		<li>We are currently planning to offer face-to-face counseling this academic year, but remain flexible to offer remote therapy as well.</li>
