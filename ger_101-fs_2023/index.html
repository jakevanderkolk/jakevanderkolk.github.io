    <h3 id="description" style="clear:both;">Course Description and Objectives</h3>
    <div class="body">
      <p>In German 101, you will start learning to communicate in German through speaking, writing, listening, reading, and cultural knowledge. Over the course of the semester, you will learn vocabulary (as well as grammatical and cultural knowledge) in order to interpret oral and written language, to interact with other speakers, and to express yourself. Students who diligently complete the tasks of this course will meet or exceed the <a href="https://www.actfl.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/public/ACTFLProficiencyGuidelines2012_FINAL.pdf">ACTFL "Novice" levels (see page 9)</a> for speaking, reading, listening, and writing.</p>
      <p>Our course will include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>in-class activities, including pair and group work focusing on using the new structures and vocabulary in a variety of contexts. <i>Active participation is essential!</i></li>
        <li>daily homework, including grammar readings, vocabulary memorization, and extra practice. <i>You will learn the grammar and vocabulary just as much on your own as in class!</i></li>
        <li>cultural readings including short texts, films, TV episodes, short videos, and music</li>
        <li>a lab session once a week with our teaching assistant for extra German practice</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>Elementary German I complies with the <a href="http://bulletin.wabash.edu/academic-policies/course-information/">Wabash College Academic Credit Policy</a> stated in the Academic Bulletin. In addition to regular class meetings, direct instruction in this course takes place through lab sessions, office hours, cultural enrichment activities outside of class, face-to-face oral examinations, and feedback on written and performative work.</p>
    </div>
    <h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
    <div class="body">
      By the end of this course, students
      <ul>
        <li>will begin to develop an active vocabulary in German, focusing on those elements that are most frequently used in classroom and interpersonal communication.</li>
        <li>will acquire basic grammatical structures (e.g., verb conjugations, past-tense forms, subordinate clause constructions, etc.)</li>
        <li>will be able to read and derive meaning from short, straightforward texts.</li>
        <li>will become able to express personal meaning both orally and in writing at a novice level.</li>
        <li>explore an array of cultural topics that will deepen their understanding of German, Swiss, and Austrian culture.</li>
      </ul>For a complete description, see this <a href="https://wabash.box.com/s/zgyqmtkvg5787d113jqqbwaxpfvrcezs">course's unabridged Student Learning Outcomes document</a>.

      <p><strong>No "Textbook" Required!</strong> We are using a new online-only curriculum developed at Princeton University and adapted for Wabash students: <i><a href="https://dddgerman.org/">der|die|das</a></i>. This curriculum innovates by focusing on the 1,200 most frequently used words in German. Each chapter presents (on average) 80 words from this list, which subsequent chapters review in varying formats, allowing you to develop a solid grasp of the most frequently used words in the language. By the end of the 100-level sequence, we will have learned about 800 of the 1,200 core vocabulary words!</p>

	  <p class="body1">Please note the college's <a href="#health">Health Policy</a> below as well.</p>
      <h4>Homework (15%)</h4>
      <p class="body1">Each day you should check the homework plan posted on <a href="https://wabash.instructure.com/courses">Canvas</a>. It is your responsibility to complete homework as assigned on a daily basis.</p>
      <p class="body1"><strong>Expect to spend 1-2 hours on homework and preparation for each class session.</strong> Please see me if you feel you are working more than this amount.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="body1"></p>
      <h4>Chapter Tests (50%, 10% each)</h4>
      <p class="body1">Each chapter will have a test, which will include cultural content from our course. While focusing on new material, each test assumes continued mastery of the previous chapters.</p>
      <ul class="body1">
	    <li><strong>Missing a Test.</strong> Each test must be taken by posted test date, not later. If you miss a test session, make plans with me to take <i>before</i> that session.</li>
		<li><strong>Test remediation.</strong> You can earn up to 50% of the points you lost on your test back by correcting your mistakes within 5 days of receiving your test back.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Final Oral Exam (10%)</h4>
      <p class="body1">There will be a final oral exam that you do with a partner.</p>
      <h4>Cultural Enrichment (5%)</h4>
      <p class="body1">Over the semester, you will participate in a certain number of cultural enrichment activities outside of class related to German-speaking culture, like watching a movie or attending a German Club meeting. <a href="./enrichment.html">See this list for possible activities</a>.</p>
      <p class="body1">You will submit a short report on the activity (in English) or provide some other evidence of completion. The number of necessary activities will depend on the amount of effort required, as well as when you submit your report (submissions in November count less than those in August).</p>

    <h3 id="succeeding">How to Succeed</h3>

      <p>The most successful students typically do the following:</p>
      <ul>
		  <li><strong>Exercise Self Care</strong>
			  <ul>				  
		          <li><strong>Get your sleep!</strong> 7-9 hours (in a row).</li>
		          <li><strong>Eat well and exercise.</strong> Manage your diet and get some physical activity every day.</li>
		          <li><strong>Be mindful of substance use.</strong> A clear brain works and feels better.</li>
		          <li><strong>Get involved.</strong> Make friends. Participate in sports, clubs, etc. Find your niche.</li>
			 </ul>
		</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Get your money's worth:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Use office hours.</strong> Email me to make an appointment, or feel free to "stop by" with questions! <strong>Don't suffer from FMOOWMP! →</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Talk a lot! Make <u>lots</u> of mistakes!</strong> Talking a lot instead of well is the best way to learn. You will make mistakes as you try out new vocabulary and grammar. This shows me how you've been learning.</li>
            <li><strong>Ask questions!</strong> When you’re lost, confused, or have a question, someone else probably has the same one (and they’ll be glad you asked).</li>
            <li><strong>Overwhelmed? Frustrated? Get help NOW</strong>! This course builds on itself, so any issue you have now will only get bigger. Save yourself aggravation and extra work further down the line by taking advantage of the extra videos I post, e-mailing me, or coming to my office hours.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Keep up.</strong> College language classes move fast and require sustained engagement. Students most often fail language courses because they fall behind. Make sure to:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Show up.</strong> Even with make-up assignments, missing one or (even worse) several sessions in a row makes everything you learn afterwards harder. Make things easier on yourself and be here when you can. Be absent as sparingly as possible!</li>
            <li><strong>Complete all assignments <u>on time.</u></strong> Missing a day's worth of homework won't just cost you points, it will leave you unprepared for the next day's lesson and the next assignment.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Learn smarter, not longer.</strong> Studies show that people retain knowledge better and quicker when they learn small amounts at a time and review repeatedly. With a little foresight and planning, you can save time and frustration if you:
          <ul>
			<li><strong>Build a routine.</strong> Set aside a time every day, every other day, or every few hours to do your work. Make it a habit.</li>
			<li><strong>Small tasks.</strong> Cramming is much less efficient than breaking assignments into a series of smaller, manageable tasks that allow your mind time to digest what it just learned.</li>
            <li><strong>Be opportunistic.</strong> Use time that you might waste (e.g. standing in a long line, eating by yourself, waiting for class to start) practicing vocabulary instead of viewing cat photos on your phone.</li>
            <li><strong>Take breaks.</strong> Give yourself time to let things sink in when studying. Schedule a break every so often so that you don't work for more than an hour at a time.</li>
            <li><strong>If you get stuck, revisit later.</strong> If a particular lesson or exercise frustrates you, put it aside for a while, work on something else for a while, and let your brain reset. It may make sense later.</li>
			<li><strong>Put in the time.</strong> Language learning isn't hard, but it does take time. We expect you to work up to 12 hours a week outside of class on coursework.</li>
            <li><strong>If you need more than 12 hours/week to keep up, or just feel overwhelmed, get help!</strong> Come and see me in my office hours, so that we can hash out methods that will work specifically for you.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Find study partners.</strong> Get to know your classmates and form groups in which you can collaborate on day-to-day assignments, and study for tests. But make sure you still do your own work!</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Master the basics.</strong> We learn the most basic language first because it is the most important, so be patient. Before you can sprint, you need to know how to crawl.</u>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Vocabulary, vocabulary, vocabulary!</strong> Having a strong working vocabulary makes everything easier and faster. Learn a few words every day. Use our Quizlet utilities or (even better) old-fashioned paper flash cards – find what works for you!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Make learning fun!</strong> Make class fun and welcoming for yourself and your classmates by participating in lighthearted yet <u>respectful</u> ways.</li>
        <li><strong>Celebrate your progress!</strong> You are doing something amazing: Over the next 15 weeks you will learn what took you <u>years</u> in your first language. Celebrate that every once in a while.</li>

        *Online translators haven't been the best at translating. A student, who was going to be absent in a course, once sent this email to a colleague named Rob:
        <div class="subnote">
          <i>Lieber Fruchtsirup: Ich verpasse heute die Kategorie</i>.<br>
          <br>
          English: <i>Dear Fruit Syrup: I'm passing by the category today.</i>†
          <div style="text-align: right;font-size:0.8em;">
            †She had entered "Dear Rob: I'm missing class today." in an online translator.
          </div>
        </div>Instead, rely first on the vocabulary you have learned and thus know well!

      <h4>The Gentleman's Rule</h4>
      <p class="body1">As with all other facets of Wabash life, the Gentleman's Rule applies to your interactions with me and your colleagues inside and outside the classroom, as well as to the completion of all academic requirements of the course. Except for leading an article discussion and data collection for the minilabs, all assignments and exams are to be completed independently, with no assistance from other people or other students’ work. Remember the Wabash mission statement: “Wabash College educates men to think critically, act responsibly, lead effectively, and live humanely.” Acting responsibly includes not cheating. <u>If there are any questions about how the standards of academic integrity apply to a specific assignment or test, please do not hesitate to talk with me for clarification <strong>before</strong> handing in the assignment.</u> Uncertainty about the application of these principles will not excuse a violation. Remember that you can be expelled for academic
      dishonesty!</p>
      <p class="body1">The general principle is that you should <strong>always submit work that is entirely your own.</strong> Here are some specific examples of academic dishonesty:</p>
      <ul class="body1">
        <li>Copying another student's exam or assignment – either a current or past student.</li>
        <li>Collaborating with another student on your term paper, article discussion summary, or minilab writeup.</li>
        <li>Using another student's notes for your article discussion summary.</li>
        <li>Copying any text from the internet (or other resource) on an assignment.</li>
        <li>Paraphrasing any text from any resource without providing a reference.</li>
        <li>Extensive paraphrasing of text from any resource even when providing a reference.</li>
        <li>Turning in the same assignment to multiple courses, in the same or different semesters, without prior consent from both professors.</li>
        <li>Taking another student’s graded assignment without his permission.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="body1">This is not an exhaustive list of violations. If you have a question, ask before you turn in the assignment.</p>
      <p class="body1">If I find out that you have cheated on an assignment, you will receive ZERO points for that assignment, and I will turn you into the Dean for an academic dishonesty strike.</p>
      <h4>Use of Generative AI</h4>
      <p class="body1">The use of generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Bing, Bard [LaMDA], Copilot, AlphaCode, DALL-E, Midjourney, etc) on any assignment without specific permission is a form of academic dishonesty. Such tools prevent you from engaging with important concepts and topics. As professors, we want to know what you think, how you developed your ideas, and how you see your ideas interacting with others. Please talk to your professor if you have questions.</p>
      <h4 id="health">Student Health Center</h4>
	  <p class="body1">The Student Health Center is located on the second floor of the Allen Athletics Center, and is open from 8:30 am- 2 pm M-F while school is in session. Visits to the Student Health Center are unlimited and are covered by the annual Health Services fee. To schedule a visit, please send the SHC a message via the secure health portal. Instructions are on our website (<a href="https://www.wabash.edu/studentlife/health">https://www.wabash.edu/studentlife/health</a>). Clinic walk-in hours are from 9-11am, M-F, for nursing evaluation and advice. <strong>If you have had new onset of a fever, cough, vomiting, or diarrhea in the last 24 hours, please contact the instructor and isolate yourself from others in your living unit.</strong> You may walk in at the SHC between 9-11am if you wish to have rapid testing done for flu, COVID, strep throat, etc. and to have your condition evaluated.</p>
      <h4>Accommodations</h4>
	  <p class="body1">Students with disabilities (apparent or invisible) are invited to confidentially discuss their situation with the disability coordinator, Heather Thrush, Associate Dean for Student Engagement and Success (in the Armory). If a student wishes to receive an academic accommodation, it is required that his documentation of the disability be on file with Dean Thrush, who can, in confidence, provide information and guidance. Early notification helps us all work together in the most effective ways. To make an appointment with Dean Thrush, call x6347 or email <a href="mailto:thrushh@wabash.edu">thrushh@wabash.edu</a>.</p>
      <h4>The Office of Student Enrichment</h4>
      <p class="body1">Succeeding at Wabash College takes a great deal of effort and planning. Life is complex, assignments are time consuming, and staying involved keeps you running. When you have questions about how to make everything fit into your schedule, how to study more efficiently, how to take better notes, or any other question about developing your college skills, visit the Office of Student Enrichment (OSE).

      <h4>Counseling Center</h4>
	  <p class="body1">The purpose of the Wabash College Counseling Center is to promote mental wellness by providing brief, therapeutic interventions and support as well as continued care for more chronic mental health conditions. Counseling is available at no additional charge to students, their dependents, if any, and the college FLTAs and is located in the Kendall House (501 Crawford Street, the 2-story brick house with the white picket fence between the Allen Center and the tennis courts).
