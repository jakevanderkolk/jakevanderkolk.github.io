        <div class="body">
            <p>In German 101, you will start learning to communicate in German through speaking, writing, listening, reading, and cultural knowledge. Over the course of the semester, you will learn vocabulary (as well as grammatical and cultural knowledge) in order to interpret oral and written language, to interact with other speakers, and to express yourself. Students who diligently complete the tasks of this course will meet or exceed the "Novice" levels for speaking, reading, listening, and writing as defined by <a href="https://www.actfl.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/public/ACTFLProficiencyGuidelines2012_FINAL.pdf">ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines</a> (see page 9).</p>
            <p>Gaining proficiency in a foreign language is highly rewarding, but requires lots of input - that means exposure to German - and lots of practice! <em>I expect you to speak only in German during class and tutorials!</em> This is not always easy, but you will learn much more quickly in an immersive environment! Our course will include:
                <ul>
                    <li>in-class activities, including pair and group work focusing on using the new structures and vocabulary in a variety of contexts. <em>Active participation is essential!</em></li>
                    <li>daily homework, including grammar readings, vocabulary memorization, and extra practice. <em>You will learn the grammar and vocabulary mostly on your own, not in class!</em></li>
                    <li>cultural readings including short texts, films, TV episodes, short videos, and music</li>
                    <li>a tutorial session once a week with our TA for extra German practice</li>
                </ul>

            <h4>Participation (20%)</h4>
            <img src="https://jakevanderkolk.xyz/kein-englisch.png" alt="Deutsch, nicht Englisch sprechen!" style="float: right; margin-left: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;" width="225" height="150" />
            <p class="body1">To succeed in this course, you must <em>be prepared for class</em>, <em>attend class and all tutorials</em> (and be on time), and <em>participate actively in German</em>. Being prepared also means you have done the homework and have all materials (books, worksheets, notes, etc.) in class. Each day I take attendance and make notes about both the quantity and quality of participation, which will be factored into your participation grade. We move quickly through the material, and if you miss class, it is up to you to find out what we did that day.</p>
            <p class="body1"><strong>Absence Policy.</strong> Please email me in advance if you will miss class. You are allowed up to <em>four</em> absences during the quarter (between both class and tutorial), including college-sanctioned events, illness, and family emergencies. <strong>For each absence after four absences, your participation grade will be lowered a letter grade: B+ changes to C+, etc.</strong> Please contact me about extenuating circumstances.</p>
            <p class="body1"><strong>Tutorials.</strong> In addition to regular class meetings, you will also have one 50-minute tutorial each week. These sessions continue the work begun in class and will allow you to practice your German in a small group with a native speaker. The same attendance and participation policies apply to the tutorials, so you should always come prepared to use the structures and vocabulary you have learned in class.
                <div class="note"><u>Note:</u> Our TA serves as an authentic speech model in the target language and to give you guidance in proper German structure and idiomatic usage of the language, and not as proofreader.</div>
            </p>
            <h4>Homework (15%)</h4>
            <p class="body1">Each day you should check the homework plan posted on Canvas. Course assignments include a mix of online homework and written (or typed) assignments. It is your responsibility to complete homework as assigned on a daily basis. We move quickly in class, so if you miss a day or two of homework, you might find yourself lost. <strong>Expect to spend 1-2 hours on homework and preparation for each class session.</strong> Please see me if you feel you are working more than this amount.</p>
            <p class="body1"><strong>Online Homework.</strong> These exercises allow me to check your understanding and see that you are keeping up with the course. Moreover, online assignments provide instant feedback and corrections.</p>
            <p class="body1"><strong>Wortschatz.</strong> Vocabulary is the main building block of language. Each day you should study an assigned section of the chapter vocabulary. <em>Studies have shown that learning a few words each days is much better than trying to memorize a list right before a test.</em> The <i>der|die|das</i> website has flash cards for the chapter vocabulary, or you can use an app like <a href="https://www.memrise.com">Memrise</a>.</p>
            <h4>Chapter Texts (50%, 10% each)</h4>
            <p class="body1">For each chapter we will have a test to give you immediate feedback on your understanding of the structures and vocabulary. Tests will also include cultural content from our course. While focusing on new material, each test assumes continued mastery of the previous chapters.</p>
            <p class="body1">Each test must be taken on the scheduled day. Students who have conflicts due to athletics or personal matters must make prior arrangements with me. Following a missed test or exam, students must provide written notification from an appropriate administrative official. Otherwise, the test will not be rescheduled and will receive a score of "0."</p>
            <h4>Final (15%)</h4>
            <p class="body1">There will be a final exam, which will include both an oral and written portion.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="succeeding">How to Succeed</h3>

        <div class="body">
            <iframe style="margin-left: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;border-width:1px;border-color:white;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yQq1-_ujXrM" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="280" height="158" frameborder="0" align="right"></iframe>
            <p>The most successful students typically do the following:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use office hours.</strong> Email me to make an appointment, or feel free to stop by with questions! <strong>Don't suffer from FMOOWMP! &#8594;</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Speak lots! Make <em>lots</em> of mistakes!</strong>  We use our precious class time for lots of speaking practice. I expect (and want!) you to make mistakes as you try out new vocabulary and grammar. This shows me how you've been learning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ask questions!</strong> When youâre lost or confused, or have a question in class, someone else probably has the same one (and theyâll be glad you asked). </li>
                    <li><strong>Complete all assignments <em>on time.</em></strong> Everything that we learn in this course builds on what we have learned earlier. Missing a dayâs worth of homework won't just cost you points, it will leave you unprepared for the next dayâs lesson and the next assignment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Learn smarter, not longer.</strong> Studies show that people retain knowledge better when they learn teaspoons of it at a time and review repeatedly. You can save time and frustration if you:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Study moderate amounts every day.</strong> <em>You canât learn a language by cramming.</em> You need to build your long-term memory. Instead of doing all your homework right before it is due or memorizing the vocabulary the night before a test, do a moderate amount every day and give yourself time to review your work.</li>
                            <li><strong>Take breaks.</strong> If you do all your coursework in one big sitting, you may not be giving yourself time to let things "sink in." Donât work for more than an hour without taking some sort of a break.</li>
                            <li><strong>If you get stuck, revisit later.</strong> If a particular lesson or exercise frustrates you, put it aside, move on to the next item, and let your brain reset. It may make sense later.</li>
                            <li><strong>If you need more than 2 hours/day to keep up, or just feel overwhelmed, get help!</strong> Come and see me in my office hours, so that we can hash out methods that will work specifically for you.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><img src="https://jakevanderkolk.xyz/krampus.png" alt="Krampus liebt den Wortschatz" style="float:right; margin-left: 0.5em; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;" width="258" height="200" /><strong>Find study partners.</strong> Get to know your classmates and form groups in which you can collaborate on day-to-day assignments, and study for tests. But make sure you still do your own work!</li>
                    <li><strong>Get help when you need it.</strong> If you feel overwhelmed or just don't understand something, get help <strong>NOW</strong>. This will save you aggravation and extra work further down the line. Take advantage of the videos on our Extra Help page, e-mail me, or come to my office hours.</li>
                    <li><strong>Master the basics.</strong> Focus on learning the fundamentals rather than trying to directly âcopyâ over from English. It took you decades to be able to sophisticatedly enunciate complex ideas in your first language(s). <em>Rather than attempting to directly replicate this sophistication, aim instead at expressing ideas by creatively using the basics we learn here.</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Vocabulary, vocabulary, vocabulary!</strong> Having the words in your head makes comprehension and production easier and faster. Learn a few words every day. Use <i>der|die|das</i>'s flash card utilities or (even better) old-fashioned paper flash cards â find what works for you!</li>
                    <li><strong>Make learning fun!</strong> Language learning need not be serious or dull! Make class fun and welcoming for yourself and your classmates by participating in lighthearted yet <em>respectful</em> ways.</li>
                </ul>

            <h4>In the Classroom</h4>
            <p class="body1">I want our class to be a respectful environment, where all students feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions.

I look forward to a fun and productive class with you!

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Appropriate Address.</strong> In Germany, professors and students use the formal âSieâ form and last names: Herr/Frau + Last Name. We will adapt this model slightly. You can call me Dr. van der Kolk, and I will generally use Sie + First Name to address you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pronouns and Preferred Names.</strong> Please let me know as soon as possible if you have a preferred name that differs from your legal name listed in the Collegeâs records, or if you have specific pronouns that you would prefer I and others use in reference to you.</li>

                <div class="note">*Online translators havenât been the best at translating. A student, who was going to be absent in a course, once sent this email to a colleague of mine named Rob:
                    <div class="subnote"><em>Lieber Fruchtsirup: Ich verpasse heute die Kategorie</em>.<br>English: <em>Dear Fruit Syrup: I'm passing by the category today.</em>â 
                    <div style="text-align: right;font-size:0.8em;">â She had entered "Dear Rob: Iâm missing class today." in an online translator.</div>
                </div>
                Instead, rely first on the vocabulary you have learned (and thus know well!), and then use a good online dictionary like <a href="http://dict.leo.org">LEO</a> when needed.
            </div>
            <h4>The Gentleman's Rule</h4>
            <p class="body1">As with all other facets of Wabash life, the Gentleman's Rule applies to your interactions with me and your colleagues inside and outside the classroom, as well as to the completion of all academic requirements of the course. Except for leading an article discussion and data collection for the minilabs, all assignments and exams are to be completed independently, with no assistance from other people or other studentsâ work. Remember the Wabash mission statement: âWabash College educates men to think critically, act responsibly, lead effectively, and live humanely.â Acting responsibly includes not cheating. <em>If there are any questions about how the standards of academic integrity apply to a specific assignment or test, please do not hesitate to talk with me for clarification <u>before</u> handing in the assignment.</em> Uncertainty about the application of these principles will not excuse a violation. Remember that you can be expelled for academic dishonesty!</p>
            <p class="body1">The general principle is that you should <strong>always submit work that is entirely your own.</strong> Here are some specific examples of academic dishonesty:
                <ul class="body1">
                    <li>Copying another student's exam or assignment â either a current or past student.</li>
                    <li>Collaborating with another student on your term paper, article discussion summary, or minilab writeup.</li>
                    <li>Using another student's notes for your article discussion summary.</li>
                    <li>Copying any text from the internet (or other resource) on an assignment.</li>
                    <li>Paraphrasing any text from any resource without providing a reference.</li>
                    <li>Extensive paraphrasing of text from any resource even when providing a reference.</li>
                    <li>Turning in the same assignment to multiple courses, in the same or different semesters, without prior consent from both professors.</li>
                    <li>Taking another studentâs graded assignment without his permission.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="body1">This is not an exhaustive list of violations. If you have a question, ask before you turn in the assignment.</p>
            <p class="body1">If I find out that you have cheated on an assignment, you will receive ZERO points for that assignment, and I will turn you into the Dean for an academic dishonesty strike.</p>
            <h4>Accommodations</h4>
            <p class="body1">Students who need accommodations (e.g. extra time for exams, separate testing room) are asked to arrange a meeting during office hours or by appointment the <em>first week of class</em>, or as soon as possible if accommodations are needed immediately. Accommodations will not be granted unless appropriate documentation is on file with Heather Thrush, Associate Dean for Student Engagement and Success.</p>
            <p class="body1">Students with disabilities (apparent or invisible) are invited to confidentially discuss their situation with the disability coordinator, Dean Thrush. If a student wishes to receive an academic accommodation, it is required that his documentation of the disability be on file with Dean Thrush, who can, in confidence, provide information and guidance. Early notification helps us all work together in the most effective ways. Dean Thrush can be reached at her office (Center Hall 112A), by phone (x6347), or <a href="mailto:thrushh@wbash.edu">by email</a>.</p>
            <h4>The Office of Student Enrichment</h4>
            <p class="body1">Succeeding at Wabash College takes a great deal of effort and planning. Life is complex, assignments are time consuming, and staying involved keeps you running. When you have questions about how to make everything fit into your schedule, how to study more efficiently, how to take better notes, or any other question about developing your college skills, visit the Office of Student Enrichment (OSE).</p>

It's <strong>free</strong>! It's <strong>confidential</strong>, and this guarantee is taken seriously. Your contact with the counseling center is confidential between you and the counselor to the fullest extent of the law (confidentiality may be breached in cases such as when there is imminent danger to someone or a report of current abuse of a child or elder). Reasons Wabash students go to the counseling service include personal and academic questions, advice for family problems, stress, anger, grief and loss, conflicts with family or friends or guys in their living units, alcohol and other drugs, feeling edgy and anxious, relationships, motivation problems, sexuality, concerns about friends, just wanting someone neutral to talk to.
