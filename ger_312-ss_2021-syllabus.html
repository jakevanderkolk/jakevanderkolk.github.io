        <div class="body">
            <p>This course introduces you to the culture and civilization of the German people from first attestations to the Nazi period. Students examine representative periods and thinkers in German history. Beginning with the first encounters of Germanic tribes with the Roman Empire, the course proceeds to successive changes brought on by migration, Christianization, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, Nationalism, the Industrial Revolution, and political unification, with a special eye on the persistent issue of German national identity.</p>
       </div>
        <h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
        <div class="body1">By the end of this course, students will be able to
        <ul>
        <ul>
            <li>be able to read, derive meaning from, interpret, and evaluate longer, more challenging texts.</li>
            <li>improve their abilities to speak and write in academic and professional registers.</li>
            <li>explore an array of cultural topics focused in German-language cultural history.</li>
        </ul>
        For a complete description, see this <a href="http://www.example.com">course's unabridged Student Learning Outcomes document</a>.</div>
        <h4>Delivery Methods</h4>
        <div class="body1">
            <p>Our class will meet in a <strong>hyflex</strong> fashion. This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Multiple Methods of Attendance.</strong> Under normal circumstances, each session can be attended in one of three ways: (1) in-person (most preferred), (2) synchronously via Zoom, or (3) asynchronously (least preferred).
                    <ul>
                        <li>You may select from any of the above methods for any reason for any particular class session, no questions asked.</li>
                        <li>Please let me know if you will not be attending in person ahead of time.</li>
                        <li>For the Zoom and asynchronous options, you will have to do additional activities on your own to help get across what those methods can't translate.</li>
                        <li>In-person classes suspended college-wide? Nothing will change except that we will all meet through Zoom.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>You will <strong>observe social distancing and wear a mask</strong> in this course.
                    <ul>
                        <li style="font-weight:bold;">If you feel sick with <u>any</u> COVID-19 symptom, let me know, stay home, and participate through Zoom.</li>
                   </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            This course complies with the <a href="http://bulletin.wabash.edu/academic-policies/course-information/">Wabash College Academic Credit Policy</a> stated in the Academic Bulletin. In addition to regular class meetings, direct instruction takes place in this course through faculty office hours, online journal submissions, Canvas tests, and self-guided cultural enrichment activities.

            <h4 id="participation">Participation (10%)</h4>
            <p class="body1">For each class period, you will be assessed on your participation. Your final grade in this criterion will be the percentage share of sessions for which you have full credit, e.g. if you are absent and don't make up 6 classes and/or labs out of our total 55, you will get an 89%.</p>
            <div class="body1"><strong>Criteria.</strong> You must achieve each of the following to get <u>any</u> credit for a session:
                <ul>
                    <li><u>Presence.</u> You are in the meeting, either in-person or distantly, for the entire session. You are no more than 5 minutes late.
                        <ul>
                            <li id="attendance"><strong>Attendance Policy.</strong> You have three options by which you can attend this course, some of which require additionl work:
                                <ol>
                                    <li><u>In-Person Attendance.</u> (Most preferred) No additional work required besides the regular homework.</li>
                                    <li><u>Zoom Attendance.</u> Feeling sick? You can attend our class via Zoom. You will also need to complete additional homework (listed below in the assignment description) within 48 hours of attending the session.</li>
                                    <li><u>Asynchronous Attendance.</u> (Least preferred) Can't attend through either above method? You can watch the video recording after the fact and do even more additional activities within 48 hours of the in-person session. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSerSjSAIG_qnikkwwHgaahZwJQjEY5KMr9OCzX5RTCkKaqEvA/viewform?usp=sf_link">For details or to submit an asynchronous session, go to this form.</a></li>

                               If you do not complete any of the above methods for a particular session, this session will count as an unexcused absence. Special consideration will be given to those with a recognized excuse.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                   <li><u>Engagement.</u> You involve yourself in the meeting, including group and whole-class activities. If you are in a distant session, you have your video on (but stay muted unless you are speaking).</li>
                    <li><u>Preparation.</u> You come to class ready and willing to engage with the topics touched on in your homework and previous class sessions. You bring all necessary materials (books, worksheets, notes, etc.) at hand.</li>
                    <li><u>Cooperation.</u> You support and encourage your fellow students in your common effort to learn the language.</li>

            </div>
            <h4>Journal (25%)</h4>
            <p class="body1">Prior to each class day, you will write a <em>Journal</em> responding to this course's viewings and readings. Your daily contribution helps shape class discussions and identify problem spots. Your overall grade will be the percentage of assignments passed.</p>
            <div class="body1"><strong>Criteria.</strong> To get credit for a day's <em>Journal</em>, you must achieve all of the following. There is no partial credit:
                <ul>
                    <li><u>On Time.</u> You submit your daily entry by <strong>11:00 am</strong> on the day of class.</li>

                </ul>
            </div>
            <h4>Exams (60% total; 25% for the midterm, 35% for final)</h4>
            <p class="body1">You will have two exams over the course of the semester, to be completed outside of class through Canvas.</p>

            <p class="body1">Over the semester, you will participate in a certain number of cultural enrichment activities related to German-speaking culture outside of class, like watching a movie or attending a German Club meeting. <a href="./ger_312-ss_2021-extra.html">See this list for possible activities</a>.</p>
            <p class="body1">The number of necessary activities will depend on the amount of effort required, as well as when you submit your report (submissions in May count less than those in December and January).</p>

            <iframe style="margin-left: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;border-width:1px;border-color:white;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yQq1-_ujXrM" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="280" height="158" frameborder="0" align="right"></iframe>
            <p>Try the following to make your experience in this course worthwhile and less stressful:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Get your money's worth:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Use virtual office hours.</strong> Email me to make an appointment, or feel free to "stop by" with questions! <strong>Don't suffer from FMOOWMP! &#8594;</strong></li>
                           <li><strong>Ask questions!</strong> When you’re lost or confused, or have a question in class, someone else probably has the same one (and they’ll be glad you asked).</li>
                            <li><strong>Get help when you need it.</strong> If you feel overwhelmed or just don't understand something, get help <strong>NOW</strong>. This will save you aggravation and extra work further down the line. E-mail me, or come to my office hours.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Keep up.</strong> We move fast, and everything we learn in this course builds on what we previously have learned. Make sure to:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Show up.</strong> Missing one or (even worse) multiple sessions will not only hurt your participation grade, it will make each following session that much harder. Make things easier on yourself!</li>
                            <li><strong>Complete all assignments <u>on time.</u></strong> Missing a day's worth of homework won't just cost you points, it will leave you unprepared for the next day's lesson and the next assignment.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Learn smarter, not longer.</strong> Expect to put in up to (but not more than) 2 hours of work outside of class for each hour of class. However, note that studies show that people retain knowledge better when they learn small amounts at a time and review repeatedly. With a little foresight and planning, you can save time and frustration if you:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Build a routine.</strong> Set aside a few times each day to get <u>one</u> assignment done.</li>
                            <li><strong>Study opportunistically.</strong> Use time that you might waste (e.g. standing in a long line, eating by yourself, waiting for class to start) reviewing a reading or some other small task instead of viewing cat photos on your phone.</li>
                            <li><strong>Study moderate amounts every day.</strong> <u>You don't retain knowledge by cramming.</u> You need to build your long-term memory. Instead of doing all your reading and homework right before it is due or cramming the night before an exam, do a moderate amount every day and give yourself time to review your work.</li>
                            <li><strong>Take breaks.</strong> If you do all your coursework in one big sitting, you may not be giving yourself time to let things "sink in." Don’t work for more than an hour without taking some sort of a break.</li>
                            <li><strong>If you get stuck, revisit later.</strong> If a particular reading frustrates you, put it aside, move on to the next item, and let your brain reset. It may make sense later.</li>
                            <li><strong>If you need more than 6 hours/week to keep up, or just feel overwhelmed, get help!</strong> Come and see me in my office hours, so that we can hash out methods that will work specifically for you.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Find study partners.</strong> Get to know your classmates and form groups in which you can collaborate on day-to-day assignments, and study for tests. But make sure you still do your own work!</li>
                    <li><strong>Make learning fun!</strong> Learning need not be serious or dull! Make class fun and welcoming for yourself and your classmates by participating in lighthearted yet <u>respectful</u> ways.</li>
               </ul>
            </p>

        <h3 id="policies">Class Etiquette and Course Policies</h3>
        <div class="body">
            <h4>In the Classroom</h4>
            <p class="body1">I want our class to be a respectful environment, where all students feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. Please let me know if anything in class (or outside of class) makes you feel uncomfortable. I’m happy to meet with you at any point in the semester to discuss individual course performance. I look forward to a fun and productive class with you!
                <ul class="body1">
                    <li><strong>Please check your Wabash College email frequently</strong> as I use email for class communication.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pronouns and Preferred Names.</strong> Please let me know as soon as possible if you have a preferred name that differs from your legal name listed in the College’s records, or if you have specific pronouns that you would prefer I and others use in reference to you.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h4>The Gentleman's Rule</h4>
            <p class="body1">As with all other facets of Wabash life, the Gentleman's Rule applies to your interactions with me and your colleagues inside and outside the classroom, as well as to the completion of all academic requirements of the course. Except for leading an article discussion and data collection for the minilabs, all assignments and exams are to be completed independently, with no assistance from other people or other students’ work. Remember the Wabash mission statement: “Wabash College educates men to think critically, act responsibly, lead effectively, and live humanely." Acting responsibly includes not cheating. <u>If there are any questions about how the standards of academic integrity apply to a specific assignment or test, please do not hesitate to talk with me for clarification <strong>before</strong> handing in the assignment.</u> Uncertainty about the application of these principles will not excuse a violation. Remember that you can be expelled for academic dishonesty!</p>
            <p class="body1">The general principle is that you should <strong>always submit work that is entirely your own.</strong> Here are some specific examples of academic dishonesty:
                <ul class="body1">
                    <li>Copying another student's exam or assignment – either a current or past student.</li>
                    <li>Collaborating with another student on your term paper, article discussion summary, or minilab writeup.</li>
                    <li>Using another student's notes for your article discussion summary.</li>
                    <li>Copying any text from the internet (or other resource) on an assignment.</li>

            <h4>Accommodations</h4>
            <p class="body1">Students who need accommodations (e.g. extra time for exams, separate testing room) are asked to arrange a meeting during office hours or by appointment the <i>first week of class</i>, or as soon as possible if accommodations are needed immediately. Accommodations will not be granted unless appropriate documentation is on file with Heather Thrush, Associate Dean for Student Engagement and Success.</p>
           <p class="body1">Students with disabilities (apparent or invisible) are invited to confidentially discuss their situation with the disability coordinator, Heather Thrush, Associate Dean for Student Engagement and Success. If a student wishes to receive an academic accommodation, it is required that his documentation of the disability be on file with Dean Thrush, who can, in confidence, provide information and guidance. Early notification helps us all work together in the most effective ways. To make an appointment with Dean Thrush call (x6347), or <a href="mailto:thrushh@wabash.edu">email</a>. Appointments will be available via Zoom or outside with masks and social distancing.</p>
