        <div class="body">
            <p>In German 101, you will start learning to communicate in German through speaking, writing, listening, reading, and cultural knowledge. Over the course of the semester, you will learn vocabulary (as well as grammatical and cultural knowledge) in order to interpret oral and written language, to interact with other speakers, and to express yourself. Students who diligently complete the tasks of this course will meet or exceed the <a href="https://www.actfl.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/public/ACTFLProficiencyGuidelines2012_FINAL.pdf">ACTFL "Novice" levels (see page 9)</a> for speaking, reading, listening, and writing.</p>
            <p>Our course will include:
                <ul>
                    <li>in-class activities, including pair and group work focusing on using the new structures and vocabulary in a variety of contexts. <i>Active participation is essential!</i></li>
                    <li>daily homework, including grammar readings, vocabulary memorization, and extra practice. <i>You will learn the grammar and vocabulary mostly on your own, not in class!</i></li>
                    <li>cultural readings including short texts, films, TV episodes, short videos, and music</li>
                    <li>a lab session once a week with our Foreign Language Teaching Assistant (FLTA) for extra German practice</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
        <div class="body1">By the end of this course, students
        <ul>
            <li>will begin to develop an active vocabulary in German, focusing on those elements that are most frequently used in classroom and interpersonal communication.</li>
            <li>will acquire basic grammatical structures (e.g., verb conjugations, past-tense forms, subordinate clause constructions, etc.) </li>
            <li>will be able to read and derive meaning from short, straightforward texts.</li>
            <li>will become able to express personal meaning both orally and in writing at a novice level.</li>
            <li>explore an array of cultural topics that will deepen their understanding of German, Swiss, and Austrian culture.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Delivery Methods</h4>
        <div class="body1">
            <p>Our class will meet in a <strong>hyflex</strong> fashion with staggered attendance. This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Every class session will meet <strong>simultaneously in-person and distantly</strong> via teleconference.</li>
                <li><strong>Shifts.</strong> Different sets of students will attend in-person on certain days, so that we never have more than half of the class in our space at one time.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unable to attend your scheduled in-person session(s)? You may attend those sessions distantly.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Unable to attend either an in-person or distant session? You may watch the session after the fact, summarize and complete all in-class assignments as well as an extra set of assignments.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>In-person classes be suspended college-wide? Nothing will change except that we will all meet distantly.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>You will <strong>observe social distancing and wear a mask</strong> in this course.
                    <ul>
                        <li style="font-weight: bold;">If you feel sick with <u>any</u> COVID-19 symptom, let me know, stay home, and participate through video conference.</li>
                        <li>Each session, you will have (a) partner(s) from the other shift. You will communicate through voice messaging, so have a phone or similar device for every session.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>No "Textbook" Required!</strong> We are using a new online-only curriculum developed at Princeton University and adapted for Wabash students: <i><a href="https://dddgerman.org/">der|die|das</a></i>. This curriculum innovates by focusing on the 1,200 most frequently used words in German. Each chapter presents (on average) 80 words from this list, which subsequent chapters review in varying formats, allowing you to develop a solid grasp of the most frequently used words in the language. By the end of the 100-level sequence, we will have learned about 800 of the 1,200 core vocabulary words!</p>
            <p><strong>Bring a phone</strong> so that you can work with your partner in the other shift.</p>

            <h4>Participation (20%)</h4>
            <img src="./kein-englisch.png" alt="Deutsch, nicht Englisch sprechen!" style="float: right; margin-left: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;" width="225" height="150" />
            <p class="body1">For each class and lab session, you must do <i>all</i> of the following to get credit (no partial credit):</p>
            <ul class="body1">
                <li><strong>Presence.</strong> You are in the meeting, either in-person or distantly, for the entire session. You are no more than 5 minutes late.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Absence Policy.</strong> If you happen to miss attending a session either in person or distantly, you can watch the session after-the-fact and complete additional work, within <u>48 hours</u> of the session for full credit. Otherwise, this session will count as an unexcused absence.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Engagement.</strong> You involve yourself in all class meetings, including group and whole-class activities, and make a <u>good-faith</u> effort to express yourself <u>in German</u>. If you are in a distant session, you have your video on (but stay muted unless you are speaking). However:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong><s>Linguistic Correctness.</s></strong> <strong>You are <u>not</u> expected to speak perfectly,</strong> just to try your best as often as you can with the language you have learned!</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Preparation.</strong> You come to class ready and willing to practice the vocabulary, grammar, and topics touched on in your homework and previous class sessions. You have all necessary materials (books, worksheets, notes, etc.) at hand.</li>
                <li><strong>Cooperation.</strong> You support and encourage your fellow students. Be an asset to others' learning, and they will be an asset to you.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="body1">Your final grade in this criterion will be the percentage share of sessions for which you have full credit, e.g. if you are absent or talk too much in English and don't make up 6 classes and/or labs out of our total 55, you will get an 89%.</p>
            <h4>Homework (15%)</h4>
            <p class="body1">Each day you should check the homework plan posted on <a href="https://wabash.instructure.com/courses">Canvas</a>. It is your responsibility to complete homework as assigned on a daily basis.</p>
            <p class="body1"><strong>Expect to spend 1-2 hours on homework and preparation for each class session.</strong> Please see me if you feel you are working more than this amount.</p>
            <div class="body1">There is no partial credit for individual assignments. To get full credit, you must do all of the following:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>On Time.</strong> You submit the set of assignments on time, <strong>even if you will be absent that day.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Completion.</strong> You submit all parts of all assignments due that day. Every single blank of every single assignment must be filled in.</li>
                    <li>Present a <strong>good faith effort</strong>, that is, you try to genuinely engage with the material. It is <u>not</u> good faith to just copy-and-paste answers from the answer sheet or give a one word answer for a question asking for a complete sentence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Correction.</strong> You check your submission against the provided answer key and resubmit it at least once if you find significant problems.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p class="body1">Your overall grade in these criteria will be the percentage share of assignments fully completed. There are two different types of homework assignments:</p>
            <ul class="body1">
                <li><strong><i>Der|Die|Das</i> Homework.</strong> Online exercises out of our "textbook".</li>
                <li><strong>Quizlet Vocabulary.</strong> Each day you should study an assigned section of the chapter vocabulary. Every two class periods, you will have to show that you've learned the Thema's vocabulary by completing <a href="https://quizlet.com/join/cKguXS2Yn">Quizlet</a> a "Learn" or "Spell" activity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="body1"></p>
            <h4>Chapter Tests (50%, 10% each)</h4>
            <p class="body1">Each chapter will have a test, which will include cultural content from our course. While focusing on new material, each test assumes continued mastery of the previous chapters. You will take tests outside of class through Canvas.</p>
            <ul class="body1">
                <li><strong>Academic Honesty.</strong> You will be expected to complete these tests without external aids, even though you will be distant. See our <a href="#integrity">our course policy and the college policy on academic integrity below</a>. Vocabulary and grammar that we haven't learned yet will be considered academic dishonesty.</li>
                <li><strong>Missing a Test.</strong> Each test must be taken by posted deadline. Exceptions to this rule will be rare, and will require written notification from an appropriate administrative official. Otherwise, the test will not be rescheduled and will receive a score of "0".</ul>
            </ul>
            <h4>Final Oral Exam (10%)</h4>
            <p class="body1">There will be a final oral exam that you do live over Zoom with a partner.</p>
            <h4>Extra-Curricular Enrichment (5%)</h4>
            <p class="body1">Over the semester, you will participate in a certain number of extra-curricular activities related to German-speaking culture, like watching a movie or attending a German Club meeting. <a href="./ger_101-fs_2020-extra.html">See this list for possible activities</a>.</p>
            <p class="body1">You will submit a short report on the activity (in English). The number of necessary activities will depend on the amount of effort required, as well as when you submit your report (submissions in November count less than those in August).</p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="succeeding">How to Succeed</h3>

        <div class="body">
            <iframe style="margin-left: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;border-width:1px;border-color:white;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yQq1-_ujXrM" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="280" height="158" frameborder="0" align="right"></iframe>
            <p>The most successful students typically do the following:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Get your money's worth:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Use virtual office hours.</strong> Email me to make an appointment, or feel free to "stop by" with questions! <strong>Don't suffer from FMOOWMP! &#8594;</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Speak lots! Make <u>lots</u> of mistakes!</strong>  We use our precious class time for lots of speaking practice. I expect (and want!) you to make mistakes as you try out new vocabulary and grammar. This shows me how you've been learning.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ask questions!</strong> When you’re lost or confused, or have a question in class, someone else probably has the same one (and they’ll be glad you asked).</li>
                            <li><strong>Get help when you need it.</strong> If you feel overwhelmed or just don't understand something, get help <strong>NOW</strong>. This will save you aggravation and extra work further down the line. Take advantage of the extra videos I post, e-mail me, or come to my virtual office hours.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Keep up.</strong> College language courses move fast, and everything we learn in this course assumes you know what we previously have learned. Students most often fail language courses because they fall behind. Make sure to:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Show up.</strong> Missing one or (even worse) multiple sessions will make each following session that much harder. While you can do a make-up after the fact, this assignment requires much more work than attending the session in the first place. Make things easier on yourself!</li>
                            <li><strong>Complete all assignments <u>on time.</u></strong> Missing a day's worth of homework won't just cost you points, it will leave you unprepared for the next day's lesson and the next assignment.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Learn smarter, not longer.</strong> Expect to put in up to (but not more than) 2 hours of work outside of class for each hour of class and lab. However, studies show that people retain knowledge better when they learn small amounts at a time and review repeatedly. With a little foresight and planning, you can save time and frustration if you:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Build a routine.</strong> Set aside a few times every day to get <u>one</u> assignment done.</li>
                            <li><strong>Study opportunistically.</strong> Use time that you might waste (e.g. standing in a long line, eating by yourself, waiting for class to start) practicing vocabulary instead of viewing cat photos on your phone.</li>
                            <li><strong>Study moderate amounts every day.</strong> <u>You can’t learn a language by cramming.</u> You need to build your long-term memory. Instead of doing all your homework right before it is due or memorizing the vocabulary the night before a test, do a moderate amount every day and give yourself time to review your work.</li>
                            <li><strong>Take breaks.</strong> If you do all your coursework in one big sitting, you may not be giving yourself time to let things sink in. Schedule in a break so that you don't work for more than an hour without taking some sort of a break.</li>
                            <li><strong>If you get stuck, revisit later.</strong> If a particular lesson or exercise frustrates you, put it aside for a while, work on something else for a while, and let your brain reset. It may make sense later.</li>
                            <li><strong>If you need more than 6 hours/week to keep up, or just feel overwhelmed, get help!</strong> Come and see me in my office hours, so that we can hash out methods that will work specifically for you.</li>
                        </ul>

But make sure you still do your own work!</li>
                    <li><strong>Master the basics.</strong> Focus on learning the fundamentals. It took you decades to become a sophisticated speaker in your first language(s). <u>Rather than attempting to directly replicate this sophistication, aim instead at expressing ideas by creatively using the basics we learn here.</u>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Vocabulary, vocabulary, vocabulary!</strong> Having a strong working vocabulary makes everything easier and faster. Learn a few words every day. Use our Quizlet utilities or (even better) old-fashioned paper flash cards – find what works for you!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Make learning fun!</strong> Language learning need not be serious or dull! Make class fun and welcoming for yourself and your classmates by participating in lighthearted yet <u>respectful</u> ways.</li>
                    <li><strong>Celebrate your progress!</strong> When you get frustrated, remember that you are doing something amazing: Over the next 15 weeks you will learn what took you <u>years</u> in your first language. Every once in a while, celebrate that accomplisment!</li>

            </div>
            <h4>The Gentleman's Rule</h4>
            <p class="body1">As with all other facets of Wabash life, the Gentleman's Rule applies to your interactions with me and your colleagues inside and outside the classroom, as well as to the completion of all academic requirements of the course. Except for leading an article discussion and data collection for the minilabs, all assignments and exams are to be completed independently, with no assistance from other people or other students’ work. Remember the Wabash mission statement: “Wabash College educates men to think critically, act responsibly, lead effectively, and live humanely.” Acting responsibly includes not cheating. <u>If there are any questions about how the standards of academic integrity apply to a specific assignment or test, please do not hesitate to talk with me for clarification <strong>before</strong> handing in the assignment.</u> Uncertainty about the application of these principles will not excuse a violation. Remember that you can be expelled for academic dishonesty!</p>
            <p class="body1">The general principle is that you should <strong>always submit work that is entirely your own.</strong> Here are some specific examples of academic dishonesty:
                <ul class="body1">
                    <li>Copying another student's exam or assignment – either a current or past student.</li>
                    <li>Collaborating with another student on your term paper, article discussion summary, or minilab writeup.</li>
                    <li>Using another student's notes for your article discussion summary.</li>
                    <li>Copying any text from the internet (or other resource) on an assignment.</li>
                    <li>Paraphrasing any text from any resource without providing a reference.</li>
                    <li>Extensive paraphrasing of text from any resource even when providing a reference.</li>
                    <li>Turning in the same assignment to multiple courses, in the same or different semesters, without prior consent from both professors.</li>
                    <li>Taking another student’s graded assignment without his permission.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="body1">This is not an exhaustive list of violations. If you have a question, ask before you turn in the assignment.</p>
            <p class="body1">If I find out that you have cheated on an assignment, you will receive ZERO points for that assignment, and I will turn you into the Dean for an academic dishonesty strike.</p>
            <h4>Accommodations</h4>
            <p class="body1">Students who need accommodations (e.g. extra time for exams, separate testing room) are asked to arrange a meeting during office hours or by appointment the <u>first week of class</u>, or as soon as possible if accommodations are needed immediately. Accommodations will not be granted unless appropriate documentation is on file with Heather Thrush, Associate Dean for Student Engagement and Success.</p>
            <p class="body1">Students with disabilities (apparent or invisible) are invited to confidentially discuss their situation with the disability coordinator, Dean Thrush. If a student wishes to receive an academic accommodation, it is required that his documentation of the disability be on file with Dean Thrush, who can, in confidence, provide information and guidance. Early notification helps us all work together in the most effective ways. Dean Thrush can be reached at her office (Center Hall 112A), by phone (x6347), or <a href="mailto:thrushh@wbash.edu">by email</a>.</p>
            <h4>The Office of Student Enrichment</h4>
            <p class="body1">Succeeding at Wabash College takes a great deal of effort and planning. Life is complex, assignments are time consuming, and staying involved keeps you running. When you have questions about how to make everything fit into your schedule, how to study more efficiently, how to take better notes, or any other question about developing your college skills, visit the Office of Student Enrichment (OSE).</p>
            <p class="body1">Go to <a href="https://koppelmann.youcanbook.me">here</a> to arrange a one-on-one, personalized meeting with Prof. Koppelmann. No matter your questions, Prof. Koppelmann will work with you to find a solution that helps you achieve your goals.</p>
