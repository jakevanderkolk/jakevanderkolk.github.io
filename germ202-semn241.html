        <div class="body">
            <p>Can we re-experience the private thoughts of others? Along with the arrival of modern psychology and psychoanalysis, inner monolog and stream-of-consciousness fiction has offered a unique perspective into the unknowable realms of other people's minds.</p>
            <p>This seminar will follow the development of fiction that intimately depicts inner lives, starting with examples that preceded the "inner monolog" label, and proceeding through the self-proclaimed "inventor" of the technique to more recent examples. Special emphasis will be given to how trauma, death, and sexual desire have special priority in such depictions, and how this literature engages with pyschological, philosophical, historical, and even medical discourses.</p>

            <h4>Participation (10%)</h4>
            <p class="body1">I will grade your performance in and preparation for class, taking into consideration the following criteria:</p>
            <ul class="body1">
                <li><strong>Participation.</strong> You should involve yourself actively in all class meetings, including group and whole-class activities, and make a <u>good-faith</u> effort to contribute to class discussion.</li>
                <li><strong>Attendance.</strong> Please email me in advance if you will miss class. You are allowed up to <u>four</u> absences during the semester, including college-sanctioned events, illness, and family emergencies. <strong>For each absence after four absences, your participation grade will be lowered a letter grade: B+ changes to C+, etc.</strong> Please contact me about extenuating circumstances.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Reading Response (30%)</h4>
            <p class="body1">Prior to each class day, you will write a Canvas discussion forum post responding to this course's readings.</p>
            <ul class="body1">
                <li>Your daily contribution helps shape class discussions and develop ideas for your essays.</li>
                <li>You must submit your daily entry by 10:50 on the day of class.</li>
                <li>The models and prompt for each entry will be provided through <a href="https://wabash.instructure.com/courses">Canvas</a>.</li>
                <li><u>Grading.</u> You will be graded for good-faith completion, thoughtfulness, and the effort you put into this assignment. You will also be expected to respond to at least one classmate's post. <u>Think of this a practice for your essay writing!</u></li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Essays (60% total, 1st 20%, 2nd 40%)</h4>
            <p class="body1">You will write two essays during the course.</p>
            <ul class="body1">
                <li><u>Drafts.</u> Writing is a <u>process</u>! For each essay, you will submit a preview and at least two drafts.
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the short <u>Preview</u>, you will propose a topic. (10% of each essay)</li>
                        <li>In the <u>Half Draft</u>, you will present at least half of your essay, to which your peers and I will give you feedback relating to content, stylistics, and mechanics. (10% of each essay)</li>
                        <li>In the <u>Full Draft</u>, you will submit a draft which represents your best effort at a polished formal essay. I will give <u>very</u> detailed feedback. (80% of each essay)</li>
                        <li><u>Revisions</u>. With the first essay, you may make as many subsequent revised drafts as you wish. If you submit the full draft of the second essay early, you may resubmit revised drafts up through the exam date. (Recovers up to 80% of the points lost on the previous full draft)</li>
                    </ul></li>
                <li><u>Format.</u> You will submit your essays via Google Drive.</li>
                <li><u>Grading.</u> The preview and half draft will be graded for good-faith completion. The full draft will be stringently graded on content, stylistics, and mechanics. Drafts subsequent to the full draft will be graded according improvement.</li>

            <p>The most successful students typically do the following:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Get your money's worth:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Use office hours.</strong> Email me to make an appointment, or feel free to stop by with questions! <strong>Don't suffer from FMOOWMP! &#8594;</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Ask questions!</strong> When you’re lost or confused, or have a question in class, someone else probably has the same one (and they’ll be glad you asked).</li>
                            <li><strong>Get help when you need it.</strong> If you feel overwhelmed or just don't understand something, get help <strong>NOW</strong>. This will save you aggravation and extra work further down the line. E-mail me, or come to my office hours.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Keep up.</strong> We move fast, so make sure to:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Show up.</strong> Missing one or (even worse) multiple sessions will not only hurt your participation grade, it will make each following session that much harder. Make things easier on yourself!</li>
                            <li><strong>Complete all assignments <u>on time.</u></strong> Missing a day's forum post won't just cost you points, it will leave you unprepared for the day's discussion.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Learn smarter, not longer.</strong> Expect to put in up to (but not more than) 2 hours of work outside of class for each hour of class. However, note that studies show that people retain knowledge better when they learn small amounts at a time and review repeatedly. With a little foresight and planning, you can save time and frustration if you:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Study opportunistically.</strong> Got a half hour? Why not read! You don't have to do your readings in just one sitting.</li>
                            <li><strong>Do a little bit every day.</strong>  Instead of doing all your work, or writing your whole essay, the night before it's due, do a moderate amount every day and give yourself time to review your work.</li>
                            <li><strong>Take breaks.</strong> If you do all your work in one big sitting, you may not be giving yourself time to let things "sink in." Don’t work for more than an hour without taking some sort of a break.</li>
                            <li><strong>If you get stuck, revisit later.</strong> If a particular paragraph or reading frustrates you, put it aside, move on to the next item, and let your brain reset. It may make sense later.</li>
                            <li><strong>If you need more than 2 hours/day to keep up, or just feel overwhelmed, get help!</strong> Come and see me in my office hours, so that we can hash out methods that will work specifically for you.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Find study partners.</strong> Get to know your classmates and form groups in which you can collaborate on day-to-day readings, but make sure you still do your own work!</li>

            <p class="body1">I want our class to be a respectful environment, where all students feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions.

                    <li><strong>No Smartphones!</strong> Please silence your cell phones and put away laptops and tablets, unless required for class activities. If I see you texting in class it will impact your participation grade.</li>

            </p>
            <h4>The Gentleman's Rule</h4>
            <p class="body1">As with all other facets of Wabash life, the Gentleman's Rule applies to your interactions with me and your colleagues inside and outside the classroom, as well as to the completion of all academic requirements of the course. Except for leading an article discussion and data collection for the minilabs, all assignments and exams are to be completed independently, with no assistance from other people or other students’ work. Remember the Wabash mission statement: “Wabash College educates men to think critically, act responsibly, lead effectively, and live humanely." Acting responsibly includes not cheating. <u>If there are any questions about how the standards of academic integrity apply to a specific assignment or test, please do not hesitate to talk with me for clarification <strong>before</strong> handing in the assignment.</u> Uncertainty about the application of these principles will not excuse a violation. Remember that you can be expelled for academic dishonesty!</p>
            <p class="body1">The general principle is that you should <strong>always submit work that is entirely your own.</strong> Here are some specific examples of academic dishonesty:
                <ul class="body1">
                    <li>Copying another student's exam or assignment – either a current or past student.</li>
                    <li>Collaborating with another student on your term paper, article discussion summary, or minilab writeup.</li>
                    <li>Using another student's notes for your article discussion summary.</li>
                    <li>Copying any text from the internet (or other resource) on an assignment.</li>
                    <li>Paraphrasing any text from any resource without providing a reference.</li>
                    <li>Extensive paraphrasing of text from any resource even when providing a reference.</li>
                    <li>Turning in the same assignment to multiple courses, in the same or different semesters, without prior consent from both professors.</li>
                    <li>Taking another student’s graded assignment without his permission.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="body1">This is not an exhaustive list of violations. If you have a question, ask before you turn in the assignment.</p>
            <p class="body1">If I find out that you have cheated on an assignment, you will receive ZERO points for that assignment, and I will turn you into the Dean for an academic dishonesty strike.</p>
            <h4>Accommodations</h4>
            <p class="body1">Students who need accommodations (e.g. extra time for exams, separate testing room) are asked to arrange a meeting during office hours or by appointment the <i>first week of class</i>, or as soon as possible if accommodations are needed immediately. Accommodations will not be granted unless appropriate documentation is on file with Heather Thrush, Associate Dean for Student Engagement and Success.</p>
            <p class="body1">Students with disabilities (apparent or invisible) are invited to confidentially discuss their situation with the disability coordinator, Dean Thrush. If a student wishes to receive an academic accommodation, it is required that his documentation of the disability be on file with Dean Thrush, who can, in confidence, provide information and guidance. Early notification helps us all work together in the most effective ways. Dean Thrush can be reached at her office (Center Hall 112A), by phone (x6347), or <a href="mailto:thrushh@wbash.edu">by email</a>.</p>
            <h4>The Office of Student Enrichment</h4>
            <p class="body1">Succeeding at Wabash College takes a great deal of effort and planning. Life is complex, assignments are time consuming, and staying involved keeps you running. When you have questions about how to make everything fit into your schedule, how to study more efficiently, how to take better notes, or any other question about developing your college skills, visit the Office of Student Enrichment (OSE).</p>
            <p class="body1">Go to <a href="https://koppelmann.youcanbook.me">here</a> to arrange a one-on-one, personalized meeting with Prof. Koppelmann. No matter your questions, Prof. Koppelmann will work with you to find a solution that helps you achieve your goals.</p>

It's <strong>free</strong>! It's <strong>confidential</strong>, and this guarantee is taken seriously. Your contact with the counseling center is confidential between you and the counselor to the fullest extent of the law (confidentiality may be breached in cases such as when there is imminent danger to someone or a report of current abuse of a child or elder). Reasons Wabash students go to the counseling service include personal and academic questions, advice for family problems, stress, anger, grief and loss, conflicts with family or friends or guys in their living units, alcohol and other drugs, feeling edgy and anxious, relationships, motivation problems, sexuality, concerns about friends, just wanting someone neutral to talk to.
